> **Git** () is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files. It is often used to control [[Source code]] by programmers collaboratively developing  software.
>
> Design goals of Git include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows – thousands of parallel branches running on different computers. 
>
> Git was created for use in the development of the [[Linux]] kernel by [[Linus Torvalds]] and others developing the kernel.

> As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, Git maintains a local copy of the entire repository, a.k.a. repo, with history and version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. A repo is stored on each computer in a standard directory with additional, hidden files to provide version control capabilities. Git provides features to synchronize changes between repos that share history; copied (cloned) from each other. For collaboration, Git supports synchronizing with repos on remote machines. Although all repos (with the same history) are peers, developers often use a central server to host a repo to hold an integrated copy.

> Today, Git is the de facto standard version control system. It is the most popular distributed version control system, with nearly 95% of developers reporting it as their primary version control system as of 2022. It is the most widely used source-code management tool among professional developers. There are offerings of Git repository services, including GitHub, SourceForge, Bitbucket and GitLab.
