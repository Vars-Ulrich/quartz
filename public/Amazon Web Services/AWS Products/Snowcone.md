# Snowcone
AWS Snowcone is the smallest member of the AWS Snow Family of edge computing, edge storage, and data transfer devices. Weighing in at 4.5 pounds (2.1 kg), AWS Snowcone is equipped with 8 terabytes of usable storage, while AWS Snowcone Solid State Drive (SSD) supports 14 terabytes of usable storage. Both referred to as Snowcone, the device is ruggedized, secure, and purpose-built for use outside of a traditional data center. Its small form factor makes it a perfect fit for tight spaces or where portability is a necessity and network connectivity is unreliable. You can use Snowcone in backpacks on first responders, or for IoT, vehicular, and drone use cases. You can execute compute applications at the edge, and you can ship the device with data to AWS for offline data transfer, or you can transfer data online with AWS DataSync from edge locations.
