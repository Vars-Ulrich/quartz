# Wavelength
AWS Wavelength extends the AWS cloud to a global network of 5G edge locations to enable developers to innovate and build a whole new class of applications that require ultra-low latency. Wavelength Zones provide a high-bandwidth, secure connection to the parent AWS Region, allowing developers to seamlessly connect to the full range of services in the AWS Region through the same APIs and toolsets.
