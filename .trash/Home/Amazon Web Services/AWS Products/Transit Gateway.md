# Transit Gateway
AWS Transit Gateway connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub. This simplifies your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships. It acts as a cloud router – each new connection is only made once. As you expand globally, inter-Region peering connects AWS Transit Gateways using the AWS global network.
