# CodeCommit
AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service that hosts secure Git-based repositories. It makes it easy for teams to collaborate on code in a secure and highly scalable ecosystem.
CodeCommit eliminates the need to operate your own source control system or worry about scaling its
infrastructure. It cannot be used to automate code deployment.
