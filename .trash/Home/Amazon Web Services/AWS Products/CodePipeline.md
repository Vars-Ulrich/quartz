# CodePipeline
AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service that enables you to model, visualize, and
automate the steps required to release your software. With AWS CodePipeline, you model the full release process
for building your code, deploying to pre-production environments, testing your application and releasing it to
production.

AWS CodePipeline integrates with AWS services such as AWS CodeCommit, Amazon S3, AWS CodeBuild, AWS
CodeDeploy, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CloudFormation, AWS OpsWorks, Amazon ECS, and AWS Lambda. To
further elucidate, CodePipeline cannot by itself deploy the code, it can integrate with CodeDeploy for the actual
deployment.
