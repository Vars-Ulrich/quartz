This frees clients from managing, scaling, and patching hardware and operating systems.\nOne of the foundational services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, with extremely high availability, which can be interacted with over the internet via REST APIs, a CLI or the AWS console.  AWS’s virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; Hard-disk(HDD)/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).\nAWS services are delivered to customers via a network of AWS server farms located throughout the world. Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a “Pay-as-you-go” model), hardware, operating system, software, or networking features chosen by the subscriber require availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either. Amazon provides select portions of security for subscribers (e.g. physical security of the data centers) while other aspects of security are the responsibility of the subscriber (e.g. account management, vulnerability scanning, patching). AWS operates from many global geographical regions including seven in North America.\nAmazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large-scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm. All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways. As of 2021 Q4, AWS has 33% market share for cloud infrastructure while the next two competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have 21%, and 10% respectively, according to Synergy Group.\nWikipedia\n"},"Amazon-Web-Services/Core-Principles/Core-Principles":{"title":"Core

It’s a part of theIP protocol used in networking. In the context of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), ACK is a flag that is part of the header of TCP segments, used to acknowledge the successful receipt of packets.\nWhen two devices communicate over TCP, they send each other data packets. To ensure reliable delivery, every packet that is received is acknowledged by the recipient. This acknowledgment is done using a TCP segment with the ACK flag set, which tells the sender that their packet was received successfully.\nFor example, if device A sends a packet to device B, device B will respond with an ACK packet if the packet arrives successfully. This lets device A know that it can continue sending more data. If device A doesn’t receive an ACK, it assumes the packet was lost and sends it again.\nACK is a critical mechanism in TCP’s flow control and error handling, helping to ensure that data is transmitted accurately across networks."},"Information-Technology/Active-Directory":{"title":"Active Directory","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview"},"Information-Technology/Address-Resolution-Protocol":{"title":"Address Resolution Protocol","links":["Information-Technology/IPv4"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\nARP, or Address Resolution Protocol, is a crucial network protocol used in IPv4 for mapping an Internet Protocol address (IP address) to a physical machine address that is recognized in the local network. In simpler terms, it translates IP addresses into Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, which are unique identifiers assigned to network interfaces for communications at the physical layer of a network.\nWhen a device on a local network wants to communicate with another device, it needs to know the MAC address associated with the destination IP address. If the MAC address is unknown, the device broadcasts an ARP request packet to all devices on the local network segment. The device with the matching IP address sends an ARP reply, which includes its MAC address, back to the requester. This information is then stored in the ARP cache of the requesting device for future reference, reducing the need to repeat the ARP request broadcast for subsequent communications.\nARP is a type of protocol used in the network link layer and operates below the network layer, helping to facilitate the flow of information on a local network."},"Information-Technology/Algorithm":{"title":"Algorithm","links":["Information-Technology/Automated-Decision-Making","Information-Technology/Automated-Reasoning"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nIn mathematics and computer science, an Algorithm ( ) is a finite sequence of mathematically rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. More advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as Automated Decision-Making) and deduce valid inferences (referred to as Automated Reasoning), achieving automation eventually. Using human characteristics as descriptors of machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by Alan Turing with terms such as “memory”, “search” and “stimulus”.\nIn contrast, a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results, especially in problem domains where there is no well-defined correct or optimal result.  For example, social media recommender systems rely on heuristics in such a way that, although widely characterized as “algorithms” in 21st century popular media, cannot deliver correct results due to the nature of the problem.\nAs an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing “output” and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Apache-Web-Server/Apache-Web-Server":{"title":"Apache Web Server","links":["Information-Technology/Apache-Web-Server/Apache-commands","Information-Technology/Operating-Systems/Linux/Linux","Information-Technology/Operating-Systems/Windows/Windows"],"tags":[],"content":"\nApache commands\n\n\nThe Apache HTTP Server ( ə-PATCH-ee) is a free and open-source cross-platform web server software, released under the terms of Apache License 2.0.

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software which enable machines to perceive their environment and uses learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\nAI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: “A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it’s not labeled AI anymore.”\nAlan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. The field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques, and after 2017 with the transformer architecture. This led to the AI boom of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.\nThe growing use of artificial intelligence in the 21st century is influencing a societal and economic shift towards increased automation, data-driven decision-making, and the integration of AI systems into various economic sectors and areas of life, impacting job markets, healthcare, government, industry, and education. This raises questions about the long-term effects, ethical implications, and risks of AI, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\nThe various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field’s long-term goals.\nTo reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Automated-Decision-Making":{"title":"Automated Decision-Making","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview"},"Information-Technology/Automated-Reasoning":{"title":"Automated Reasoning","links":["Information-Technology/Metalogic"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nIn computer science, in particular in knowledge representation and reasoning and Metalogic, the area of automated reasoning is dedicated to understanding different aspects of reasoning. The study of automated reasoning helps produce computer programs that allow computers to reason completely, or nearly completely, automatically. Although automated reasoning is considered a sub-field of artificial intelligence, it also has connections with theoretical computer science and philosophy.\nThe most developed subareas of automated reasoning are automated theorem proving (and the less automated but more pragmatic subfield of interactive theorem proving) and automated proof checking (viewed as guaranteed correct reasoning under fixed assumptions). Extensive work has also been done in reasoning by analogy using induction and abduction.Other important topics include reasoning under uncertainty and non-monotonic reasoning. An important part of the uncertainty field is that of argumentation, where further constraints of minimality and consistency are applied on top of the more standard automated deduction. John Pollock’s OSCAR system is an example of an automated argumentation system that is more specific than being just an automated theorem prover.\nTools and techniques of automated reasoning include the classical logics and calculi, fuzzy logic, Bayesian inference, reasoning with maximal entropy and many less formal ad hoc techniques.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/BIOS":{"title":"BIOS","links":["Unsorted-Items/Computer","Unsorted-Items/Computing","Unsorted-Items/DOS"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\nThe Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is the first thing that runs when booting a computer.  The BIOS interface is where one changes settings related to the motherboard and the low-level interaction between various hardware elements.\n\nIn computing, BIOS (, BY-oss, -⁠ohss; Basic Input/Output System, also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS, BIOS ROM or PC BIOS) is firmware used to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs and to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup). The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on an IBM PC or IBM PC compatible’s system board and exists in some UEFI-based systems to maintain compatibility with operating systems that do not support UEFI native operation. The name originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975. The BIOS originally proprietary to the IBM PC has been reverse engineered by some companies (such as Phoenix Technologies) looking to create compatible systems. The interface of that original system serves as a de facto standard.\nThe BIOS in older PCs initializes and tests the system hardware components (power-on self-test), and loads a boot loader from a mass storage device which then initializes a kernel. In the era of DOS, the BIOS provided BIOS interrupt calls for the keyboard, display, storage, and other input/output (I/O) devices that standardized an interface to application programs and the operating system. More recent operating systems do not use the BIOS interrupt calls after startup.\nMost BIOS implementations are specifically designed to work with a particular computer or motherboard model, by interfacing with various devices especially system chipset. Originally, BIOS firmware was stored in a ROM chip on the PC motherboard. In later computer systems, the BIOS contents are stored on flash memory so it can be rewritten without removing the chip from the motherboard. This allows easy, end-user updates to the BIOS firmware so new features can be added or bugs can be fixed, but it also creates a possibility for the computer to become infected with BIOS rootkits. Furthermore, a BIOS upgrade that fails could brick the motherboard. The last version of Microsoft Windows to officially support running on PCs which use legacy BIOS firmware is Windows 10 as Windows 11 requires a UEFI-compliant system.\nUnified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a successor to the legacy PC BIOS, aiming to address its technical limitations.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Bathometric-Map":{"title":"Bathometric Map","links":["tags/saa_exam_alerts"],"tags":["saa_exam_alerts"],"content":"Overview\nExam Alerts\nsaa_exam_alerts\nKey words"},"Information-Technology/Blockchain":{"title":"Blockchain","links":["tags/saa_exam_alerts"],"tags":["saa_exam_alerts"],"content":"Overview\nExam Alerts\nsaa_exam_alerts\nKey words"},"Information-Technology/Classless-Inter-Domain-Routing":{"title":"Classless Inter-Domain Routing","links":["Amazon-Web-Services/AWS-Products/Security-Groups","Information-Technology/IPv4"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\nmethod for allocating IP addresses\nUsed in Security Groups rules and AWS networking in general\nCIDR in IPv4"},"Information-Technology/Content-Delivery-Network":{"title":"Content Delivery Network","links":["Amazon-Web-Services/High-Availability","Information-Technology/Wide-Area-Network"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nA Content Delivery Network or content distribution network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers.

Direct3D: Handles all the 3D graphics calculations and rendering, and is the most widely used component of DirectX for game development.\n2. DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI): Manages low-level tasks like multi-threading and resource management in GPUs.\n3. Direct2D and DirectWrite: Provide tools for 2D graphics and text rendering, often used for developing user interfaces within applications.\n4. DirectCompute: Provides APIs for handling tasks that can be parallelized and executed on the GPU.

It provides tools to play and record sound samples.\n6. DirectInput: Manages input from various devices like keyboard, mouse, joystick, and other game controllers.\nEvolution of DirectX\nDirectX was first introduced in the mid-1990s to provide developers with a standardized way to access hardware capabilities without having to write hardware-specific code. Before DirectX, software developers had to write optimized hardware code for each type of PC configuration, which was time-consuming and limited the consumer base. With DirectX, Microsoft aimed to simplify the development of multimedia applications on its Windows platform.\nImportance in Gaming\nDirectX is crucial for PC gaming. The introduction of each new version has typically brought advanced features and performance improvements. For example, DirectX 11 introduced tessellation technology, which allows more detailed graphics, and DirectX 12, the latest major version, brought improvements like lower-level rendering API capabilities and better efficiency, which means games can run faster and look better with the same hardware.\nDirectX and Windows\nDirectX is primarily a Windows API and is a key part of Microsoft’s larger vision for gaming across its ecosystem, which includes Windows PCs and Xbox consoles. The Xbox API set has been closely aligned with DirectX, ensuring that developers can more easily develop cross-platform titles across PC and console.\nIn summary, DirectX continues to be a pivotal technology in the realm of video gaming and multimedia on Windows platforms, enabling the creation of visually stunning and high-performance games and applications."},"Information-Technology/Distributed-Denial-of-Service-Attack":{"title":"Distributed Denial of Service Attack","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"→ In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network.

An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.\nHistorically, various forms of encryption have been used to aid in cryptography. Early encryption techniques were often used in military messaging. Since then, new techniques have emerged and become commonplace in all areas of modern computing.

This can pose significant security risks, especially over unsecured networks. To address this, variants like File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS), which extends FTP with Transport Layer Security (Transport Layer Security), and SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), which uses Secure Shell (SSH) to secure transfers, are used.\nUsage\nFTP is widely used in environments where large files need to be transferred reliably and where the simplicity of the protocol is beneficial.

The name “GNU” is a recursive acronym for “GNU’s Not Unix,” which highlights the project’s original goal of creating a system compatible with Unix but entirely free software.\nCore Components of GNU\nThe GNU project encompasses a wide range of software. Key components include:\n\n\nGNU Compiler Collection (GCC): A set of compilers for various programming languages including C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, and Go. GCC is central to the development of GNU and Linux systems.\n\n\nGNU Bash: A Unix shell and command language, which is a default shell on many systems running Linux and macOS.\n\n\nGNU Core Utilities: A package of GNU versions of common management tools for handling files, text streams, and other tasks. These utilities are the basic file, shell, and text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating system.\n\n\nGNU Debugger (GDB): A portable debugger that runs on many Unix-like systems and works for many programming languages, including Ada, C, C++, Objective-C, Free Pascal, Fortran, Java, and more.\n\n\nGNU Emacs: An extensible, customizable text editor—at its core—and more because it provides an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language with extensions to support text editing.\n\n\nGNU Binutils: A collection of binary tools, including a linker, an assembler, and other tools for managing object files.\n\n\nGNU Operating System\nThe GNU operating system is intended to be a complete free software solution. It includes everything from basic programs and libraries that define the operating system to software applications that run on them. The development of the GNU operating system began in 1984, and it includes many of the official GNU software packages.\nRelationship with Linux\nWhile GNU aimed to develop a complete operating system, by the early 90s, many of its components were complete except for the kernel. In 1991, Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as a freely modifiable source code. The Linux kernel filled the gap in the GNU project, creating a fully functioning free operating system when combined with GNU components. This combination is often referred to as GNU/Linux, though it is commonly called Linux.\nPhilosophy and Licensing\nThe philosophy behind GNU emphasizes the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve software. This is embodied in the GNU General Public License (GPL), which is a widely used free software license that ensures end users the freedom to use, study, share (copy), and modify the software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed “free software.”\nThe GPL aims to guarantee these freedoms by preventing the proprietary use of free software, ensuring that all modifications and extended versions of the program are also free.

These attacks exploited vulnerabilities in the Solaris operating system , hence the name “Solar Sunrise.” The attackers managed to gain unauthorized access to over 500 military, government, and private sector networks, raising significant concerns about national security and the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber threats.\nInitially, due to the sophisticated nature of the attacks and the high-profile targets, there was speculation that the attacks were orchestrated by a foreign government, possibly as a form of cyber warfare. This led to a large-scale federal investigation involving the FBI, the Department of Defense, and other agencies, known as “Operation Solar Sunrise.”\nThe investigation eventually revealed that the attacks were not the work of a foreign government but rather the actions of two teenagers from California, working with an Israeli teenager who was known online as “Analyzer.” The revelation that relatively inexperienced hackers could penetrate and disrupt significant U.S. military systems underscored the need for stronger cybersecurity measures and prompted a reevaluation of how cyber threats were assessed and addressed.\nSolar Sunrise is often cited as a turning point in the understanding of cyber threats, leading to increased efforts to bolster cybersecurity within the U.S. government and among critical infrastructure sectors.

The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.\nJavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).\nThe ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.

It is responsible for managing the system’s resources and enabling software programs to interact with hardware without needing to know all the details of the hardware operation.\nKey Functions of a Kernel\n\n\nResource Management: The kernel allocates system resources—such as CPU time, memory, and disk space—among the various applications and processes running on a computer. It ensures that each process receives enough resources to function properly while maintaining the overall efficiency and stability of the system.\n\n\nProcess Management: It handles the creation, execution, and termination of processes. The kernel schedules processes, efficiently switching between them to provide multitasking capabilities, ensuring that the CPU’s time is used effectively and that processes do not interfere destructively with one another.\n\n\nMemory Management: The kernel manages the memory hierarchy of the system. It controls how memory is allocated to processes and handles memory protection, paging, and swapping to and from the physical storage. Memory management helps in isolating the processes from each other, preventing them from accessing each other’s data.\n\n\nDevice Management: The kernel acts as an intermediary between the hardware and the software running on the computer. It manages device drivers, which are specific programs designed to interact with hardware components. The kernel translates the high-level function calls (APIs) into the low-level commands for devices, and vice versa.\n\n\nSecurity and Access Control: It enforces security policies and manages user access control to files, data, and resources on the system. This includes managing user permissions and protecting against unauthorized access to the system.\n\n\nSystem Calls: The kernel provides a critical interface, known as system calls, through which programs can request higher-level services from the operating system, such as reading or writing files, sending network messages, or opening new processes.\n\n\nTypes of Kernels\n\n\nMonolithic Kernels: All the operating system services like process management, memory management, and device drivers are included in one large kernel. Example: Linux.\n\n\nMicrokernels: The kernel contains only the most fundamental components such as the scheduler and IPC (inter-process communication). Other services like device drivers, file system management, and network protocols run in separate processes. Example: Minix.\n\n\nHybrid Kernels: These are a compromise between monolithic and microkernels. They run some services like device drivers in the kernel space for performance while keeping others in user space for better security and stability. Example: Windows NT.\n\n\nExokernels: Directly expose hardware resources to applications, allowing library operating systems to provide more flexible and efficient mechanisms to applications. It essentially delegates more control to the application level.\n\n\nImportance of a Kernel\nThe kernel is crucial because it manages the operations of the computer and its peripherals. It is essential for the system’s stability, efficiency, and security. Kernels are designed to be as small and efficient as possible, providing only the necessary functionalities required for the OS to perform its operations, ensuring that the system remains robust and scalable."},"Information-Technology/Lightweight-Directory-Access-Protocol":{"title":"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Default Port: 389"},"Information-Technology/Local-Area-Network":{"title":"Local Area Network","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview"},"Information-Technology/MIDI-time-synced-GIFs-and-WEBP":{"title":"MIDI time-synced GIFs and WEBP","links":["tags/music","tags/midi","tags/NTP"],"tags":["music","midi","NTP"],"content":"musicmidiNTP"},"Information-Technology/Machine-Learning":{"title":"Machine Learning","links":["artificial-intelligence","Information-Technology/Algorithm","Unsorted-Items/Neural-Network"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nMachine Learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.

When applied to business problems, it is known under the name predictive analytics. Although not all machine learning is statistically based, computational statistics is an important source of the field’s methods.\nThe mathematical foundations of ML are provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods.

The primary purpose of a markup language is to define and describe elements within a document, and these definitions are usually intended to instruct software how to display and interact with the document’s content. Here are specific characteristics that delineate a language as being a markup language:\n\n\nTag-based Syntax: Most markup languages use a system of tags to denote elements in a document. These tags generally come in pairs (a start tag and an end tag), and they surround content to apply formatting or to define the structure. For example, in HTML, &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; are used to denote a paragraph.\n\n\nSeparation of Content and Presentation: Markup languages typically focus on defining the structure and content of a document, leaving presentation details (like fonts or colors) to be defined elsewhere (e.g., CSS in the case of HTML). This separation allows the same markup document to be displayed in different styles or presented in different environments.\n\n\nHuman-readable and Machine-readable: Markup languages are designed to be easy for humans to read and write, and also easy for machines to parse and generate. The syntax is generally clear and indicative of the structure of the document.\n\n\nDescriptive, not Procedural: Markup languages are descriptive; they describe what something is rather than how it should be processed. This is in contrast to programming languages, which provide detailed commands and procedures to the computer.\n\n\nExtensibility: Many markup languages allow for the definition of new tags and attributes. This extensibility lets users and developers customize the language to suit specific needs, particularly for specialized fields of use.\n\n\nExamples:\n\nHTML (HyperText Markup Language): Used to structure content on the web.\nXML (eXtensible Markup Language): A flexible language designed to store and transport data, with a focus on simplicity and usability over the Internet.\nMarkdown: A lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax, designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats.\n\nThese characteristics define the core essence of markup languages, setting them apart from other types of languages like programming languages, scripting languages, or style sheet languages."},"Information-Technology/Media-Access-Control-address":{"title":"Media Access Control address","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Information-Technology/Memory-exploitation":{"title":"Memory exploitation","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\nKey words"},"Information-Technology/Metalanguage":{"title":"Metalanguage","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nIn logic and linguistics, a Metalanguage is a language used to describe another language, often called the object language.

Here are some key components and tasks involved in NLU:\n\n\nIntent Recognition: Understanding what the user intends to do when they input text into a system. For example, determining if a user’s input in a travel booking chatbot is about booking a flight, renting a car, or finding a hotel.\n\n\nEntity Recognition: Identifying and categorizing key elements from the text into predefined categories such as names, locations, dates, and other specific data that are relevant to the interaction. For instance, extracting a date or a place name from a travel query.\n\n\nContextual Understanding: Taking into account the context in which words are used. This might involve understanding previous interactions, the specific domain of the discussion, or external factors influencing the conversation.\n\n\nSentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment expressed in the text, such as positive, negative, or neutral feelings. This is particularly useful in areas like brand monitoring and customer service.\n\n\nAmbiguity Resolution: Handling and interpreting ambiguous language, including homonyms, sarcasm, and context-dependent meanings.\n\n\nPragmatic Understanding: Going beyond literal meanings to interpret language according to its intended function, such as making a request, offering a suggestion, or giving a command.\n\n\nThe goal of NLU is to use these techniques to parse and understand human language in a way that is meaningful for specific applications, enabling more effective human-computer interactions.

The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user’s web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a “JavaScript everywhere” paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.\nNode.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).\nThe Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation.

For example, the IBM PC, Amiga 2000 and Apple IIe have an open architecture supporting plug-in cards, whereas the Apple IIc computer has a closed architecture. Open architecture systems may use a standardized system bus such as S-100, PCI or ISA or they may incorporate a proprietary bus standard such as that used on the Apple II, with up to a dozen slots that allow multiple hardware manufacturers to produce add-ons, and for the user to freely install them. By contrast, closed architectures, if they are expandable at all, have one or two “expansion ports” using a proprietary connector design that may require a license fee from the manufacturer, or enhancements may only be installable by technicians with specialized tools or training.\nComputer platforms may include systems with both open and closed architectures. The Mac mini and Compact Macintosh are closed; the Macintosh II and Power Mac G5 are open. Most desktop PCs are open architecture.\nSimilarly, an open software architecture is one in which additional software modules can be added to the basic framework provided by the architecture. Open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to major software products are the way in which the basic functionality of such products can be modified or extended.  The Google APIs are examples. A second type of open software architecture consists of the messages that can flow between computer systems. These messages have a standard structure that can be modified or extended per agreements between the computer systems. An example is IBM’s Distributed Data Management Architecture.\nOpen architecture allows potential users to see inside all or parts of the architecture without any proprietary constraints. Typically, an open architecture publishes all or parts of its architecture that the developer or integrator wants to share. The open business processes involved with an open architecture may require some license agreements between entities sharing the architecture information. Open architectures have been successfully implemented in many diverse fields, including the U.S. Navy.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Open-Systems-Interconnection-Model":{"title":"Open Systems Interconnection Model","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The OSI Model\nThe OSI Model, short for “Open Systems Interconnection,” is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology.

It interacts with software applications that implement a communicating component. This layer provides services such as email, file transfer, and web browsing.\nLayer 6 - Presentation\nThis layer translates data between the application layer and the network. It’s responsible for data encryption, decryption, compression, and conversion to ensure that data from the application layer of one system can be read by the application layer of another.\nLayer 5 - Session\nThe Session layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections between applications. It sets up, coordinates, and terminates conversations, exchanges, and dialogues between the applications at each end.\nLayer 4 - Transport\nThe Transport layer provides transparent transfer of data between end systems or hosts. It is responsible for error recovery, data integrity, and flow control mechanisms.

Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance, though its most widely used version is primarily developed by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007, with the first commercial Android device, the HTC Dream, being launched in September 2008.\nAt its core, the operating system is known as the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and is free and open-source software (FOSS) primarily licensed under the Apache License. However, most devices run on the proprietary Android version developed by Google, which ships with additional proprietary closed-source software pre-installed, most notably Google Mobile Services (GMS) which includes core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform Google Play, and the associated Google Play Services development platform. Firebase Cloud Messaging is used for push notifications. While AOSP is free, the “Android” name and logo are trademarks of Google, which imposes standards to restrict the use of Android branding by “uncertified” devices outside their ecosystem.\nOver 70 percent of smartphones based on the Android Open Source Project run Google’s ecosystem (which is known simply as Android), some with vendor-customized user interfaces and software suites, such as TouchWiz and later One UI by Samsung and HTC Sense. Competing ecosystems and forks of AOSP include Fire OS (developed by Amazon), ColorOS by Oppo, OriginOS by Vivo, MagicUI by Honor, or custom ROMs such as LineageOS.\nThe source code has been used to develop variants of Android on a range of other electronics, such as game consoles, digital cameras, portable media players, and PCs, each with a specialized user interface. Some well-known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables, both developed by Google. Software packages on Android, which use the APK format, are generally distributed through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore, Samsung Galaxy Store, Huawei AppGallery, Cafe Bazaar, GetJar, and Aptoide, or open source platforms like F-Droid.\nAndroid has been the best-selling OS worldwide on smartphones since 2011 and on tablets since 2013. As of May 2021, it had over three billion monthly active users, the largest installed base of any operating system in the world, and as of January 2021, the Google Play Store featured over 3 million apps. Android 14, released on October 4, 2023, is the latest version, and the recently released Android 12.1/12L includes improvements specific to foldable phones, tablets, desktop-sized screens and Chromebooks.\nWikipedia\n\nExam Alerts\nsaa_exam_alerts\nKey words"},"Information-Technology/Operating-Systems/BSD":{"title":"BSD","links":["Unsorted-Items/Research-Unix","Unsorted-Items/FreeBSD"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nThe Berkeley Software Distribution or Berkeley Standard Distribution (BSD) is a discontinued operating system based on Research Unix, developed and distributed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California, Berkeley.

Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word “Linux” in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses and recommends the name “GNU/Linux” to emphasize the use and importance of GNU software in many distributions, causing some controversy.\nPopular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora Linux, Arch Linux, and Ubuntu. Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise. Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma. Distributions intended for servers may not have a graphical user interface at all, or include a solution stack such as LAMP. Because Linux is freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.\nLinux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system. Because of the dominance of Linux-based Android on smartphones, Linux, including Android, has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems as of May 2022. Linux is, as of March 2024, used by around 4 percent of desktop computers, the Chromebook, which runs the Linux kernel-based ChromeOS, dominates the US K–12 education market and represents nearly 20 percent of sub-$300 notebook sales in the US. Linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the top one million web servers’ operating systems are Linux), leads other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and is used on all of the world’s 500 fastest supercomputers (as of November 2017, having gradually displaced all competitors).\nLinux also runs on embedded systems, i.e., devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system. This includes routers, automation controls, smart home devices, video game consoles, televisions (Samsung and LG Smart TVs), automobiles (Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and Toyota), and spacecraft (Falcon 9 rocket, Dragon crew capsule, and the Perseverance rover).\nLinux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. The source code may be used, modified, and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL).

PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.\nPHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist that can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.\nThe standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.\nThe PHP language has evolved without a written formal specification or standard, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard that other implementations aimed to follow.\nW3Techs reports that as of 23 March 2024 (the four months after the PHP 8.3 release), PHP is used by 76.4% of all websites whose programming language could be determined, and 57.2% thereof use PHP 7 which is outdated and known to be insecure.

This model allows users to access software applications on a subscription basis without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware. SaaS is one of the primary categories of cloud computing, alongside Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)  and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).\nKey Characteristics of SaaS\n\n\nHosted Remotely: The software applications are hosted on remote servers managed by the SaaS provider, rather than on the user’s premises. This centralizes the maintenance, updates, and infrastructure management tasks.\n\n\nSubscription Model: Users typically pay for SaaS applications through a subscription fee, which may be monthly or annually based. This fee often includes the software license, support, software updates, and security.\n\n\nAccessibility: SaaS applications are accessed through web browsers, making them accessible from any internet-connected device. This provides flexibility and mobility since users can access the applications from anywhere.\n\n\nMulti-Tenancy: A single instance of the software and its supporting infrastructure serves multiple customers. Each customer’s data and configurations are kept separate, typically through a concept called tenant isolation.\n\n\nScalability: SaaS providers offer scalable services, with customers able to choose from various subscription levels based on their needs. Users can typically adjust their level of service as needed, scaling up or down as their business changes.\n\n\nBenefits of SaaS\n\nCost-Effective: Reduces the cost of software ownership by eliminating the need for hardware purchases, maintenance, and IT staff for software management.\nQuick Setup and Deployment: Since the software is already installed and configured in the cloud, setup times are minimal, allowing businesses to activate and use applications quickly.\nAutomatic Updates: Providers manage all updates and upgrades, eliminating the need for users to download or install patches. This ensures that all users have access to the most current features and compliance standards.\nFlexibility and Integration: Many SaaS applications offer APIs that allow for integration with other business applications, often enhancing the capabilities of both.\n\nChallenges of SaaS\n\nData Security: As data is stored on external servers, businesses must trust the provider to secure their data and protect their privacy.\nControl Limitations: Customers have less control over the software’s function and execution than they would with on-premises solutions.\nDependence on Internet: Since the software is accessed over the internet, a reliable internet connection is crucial for performance. If the provider experiences downtime, this can directly impact the availability of the service.\n\nUse Cases\n\nBusiness Applications: CRM systems like Salesforce, productivity suites like Google Workspace and Microsoft 365, and HR tools like Workday.\nEmail and Communications: Services such as Gmail and Microsoft Outlook that offer hosted email solutions are classic examples of SaaS.\nCustomer Service and Support: Tools like Zendesk and Freshdesk that provide customer service and engagement platforms.\n"},"Information-Technology/Speech-Synthesis-Markup-Language":{"title":"Speech Synthesis Markup Language","links":["XML","Information-Technology/Markup-Language","Text-To-Speech","Virtual-Assistants"],"tags":[],"content":"Speech Synthesis Markup Language.

It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.\nIntroduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, i.e., with or without an index.\nOriginally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements, which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: Data query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML).The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update, and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.\nSQL was one of the first commercial languages to use Edgar F. Codd’s relational model. The model was described in his influential 1970 paper, “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks”.  Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, SQL became the most widely used database language.SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. Since then, the standard has been revised multiple times to include a larger set of features and incorporate common extensions. Despite the existence of standards, virtually no implementations in existence adhere to it fully, and most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/StuxNet":{"title":"StuxNet","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\nKey words"},"Information-Technology/Time-to-live":{"title":"Time to live","links":["tags/saa_exam_alerts"],"tags":["saa_exam_alerts"],"content":"Overview\nExam Alerts\nsaa_exam_alerts\nKey words"},"Information-Technology/Transmission-Control-Protocol":{"title":"Transmission Control Protocol","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Information-Technology/Transport-Layer-Security":{"title":"Transport Layer Security","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview"},"Information-Technology/User-Datagram-Protocol":{"title":"User Datagram Protocol","links":["Information-Technology/Internet-Protocol","Information-Technology/Transmission-Control-Protocol","Unsorted-Items/Stream-Control-Transmission-Protocol"],"tags":[],"content":"\nIn computer networking, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core communication protocols of the Internet protocol suite used to send messages (transported as datagrams in packets) to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues and thus exposes the user’s program to any unreliability of the underlying network; there is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. If error-correction facilities are needed at the network interface level, an application may instead use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) which are designed for this purpose.\nUDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the protocol stack. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an option in a real-time system.\nThe protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 768.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Web3":{"title":"Web3","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Web3 is a burgeorning way of architecting the world wide web"},"Information-Technology/Wide-Area-Network":{"title":"Wide Area Network","links":["Information-Technology/Local-Area-Network","Information-Technology/Metropolitan-Area-Network"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nA WAN is a telecommunications extending over a large geographical area for the purpose of computer networking.\nUsed to connect smaller networks, such as:\n\nLANs\nMANs\n\n\n\n"},"Information-Technology/Wiki":{"title":"Wiki","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nA Wiki (  WI-kee) is a form of online hypertext publication that is collaboratively edited and managed by its own audience directly through a web browser.

It was intended as an advanced storage subsystem for the Microsoft Windows operating system, designed for persistence and management of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.\nWinFS includes a relational database for storage of information, and allows any type of information to be stored in it, provided there is a well defined schema for the type. Individual data items could then be related together by relationships, which are either inferred by the system based on certain attributes or explicitly stated by the user. As the data has a well defined schema, any application can reuse the data; and using the relationships, related data can be effectively organized as well as retrieved. Because the system knows the structure and intent of the information, it can be used to make complex queries that enable advanced searching through the data and aggregating various data items by exploiting the relationships between them.\nWhile WinFS and its shared type schema make it possible for an application to recognize the different data types, the application still has to be coded to render the different data types. Consequently, it would not allow development of a single application that can view or edit all data types; rather, what WinFS enables applications to do is understand the structure of all data and extract the information that they can use further. When WinFS was introduced at the 2003 Professional Developers Conference, Microsoft also released a video presentation, named IWish, showing mockup interfaces that showed how applications would expose interfaces that take advantage of a unified type system. The concepts shown in the video ranged from applications using the relationships of items to dynamically offer filtering options to applications grouping multiple related data types and rendering them in a unified presentation.\nWinFS was billed as one of the pillars of the “Longhorn” wave of technologies, and would ship as part of the next version of Windows.  It was subsequently decided that WinFS would ship after the release of Windows Vista, but those plans were shelved in June 2006, with some of its component technologies being integrated into ADO.NET and Microsoft SQL Server.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/YAML":{"title":"YAML","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"YAML () (see § History and name) is a human-readable data serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications applications as Extensible Markup Language (XML) but has a minimal syntax that intentionally differs from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). It uses Python-style indentation to indicate nesting and does not require quotes around most string values (it also supports JSON style […] and {…} mixed in the same file).Custom data types are allowed, but YAML natively encodes scalars (such as strings, integers, and floats), lists, and associative arrays (also known as maps, dictionaries or hashes). These data types are based on the Perl programming language, though all commonly used high-level programming languages share very similar concepts. The colon-centered syntax, used for expressing key-value pairs, is inspired by electronic mail headers as defined in RFC 822, and the document separator --- is borrowed from MIME (RFC 2046). Escape sequences are reused from C, and whitespace wrapping for multi-line strings is inspired by HTML.  Lists and hashes can contain nested lists and hashes, forming a tree structure; arbitrary graphs can be represented using YAML aliases (similar to XML in SOAP). YAML is intended to be read and written in streams, a feature inspired by SAX.Support for reading and writing YAML is available for many programming languages. Some source-code editors such as Vim, Emacs, and various integrated development environments have features that make editing YAML easier, such as folding up nested structures or automatically highlighting syntax errors.\n\nThe official recommended filename extension for YAML files has been .yaml since 2006.

It’s a fundamental concept in music theory that helps musicians understand and organize the structure of music in terms of harmonic relationships. Here’s how it works:\nStructure\n\nCircle Arrangement: The circle is arranged with 12 points like the face of a clock. Each point represents a musical key.\nFifths Relationship: Starting from any point, moving clockwise, each successive point represents a key a perfect fifth higher. For example, if you start at C, the next point clockwise is G (a perfect fifth above C).\nThirds Relationship: Conversely, moving counterclockwise, each point represents a key a perfect fourth higher (which is the same as a perfect fifth lower). For example, from C counterclockwise, the next point is F.\n\nKey Signatures\n\nSharps and Flats: As you move clockwise, key signatures gain sharps; as you move counterclockwise, they gain flats. C major, at the top of the circle, has no sharps or flats. Moving clockwise, G major has one sharp, D major has two sharps, and so on. Moving counterclockwise from C, F major has one flat, B♭ major has two flats, etc.\nMinor Keys: Each major key on the circle has a relative minor key that shares its key signature. These are usually shown on the inner circle. For example, A minor is the relative minor of C major and is positioned directly inward from C on the circle.\n\nUses in Music\n\nHarmonic Progressions: The circle of fifths explains why certain chords progress naturally to others in Western music. Chord progressions often move along the circle, which sounds harmonically pleasing.\nModulation and Key Changes: The circle helps musicians plan and understand key changes, particularly modulations to closely related keys (adjacent on the circle).\nImprovisation and Composition: Knowing which keys and chords are closely related helps musicians improvise and compose music more coherently.\n\nVisualizing the Circle\n\nAt the top (0 o’clock), you have C major/A minor.\nClockwise, you add sharps: G major/E minor, D major/B minor, A major/F♯ minor, etc.\nCounterclockwise, you add flats: F major/D minor, B♭ major/G minor, E♭ major/C minor, etc.\n\nThe circle of fifths is not just a theoretical tool; it’s practically useful for all kinds of musicians, from composers and improvisers to those learning the basics of musical harmony. It helps in understanding how melodies, harmonies, and scales are interconnected, making it easier to learn new music and predict chord progressions."},"People/Fridtjof-Nansen":{"title":"Fridtjof Nansen","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview"},"People/H.-G.-Wells":{"title":"H.

His poems had been in publication for less than four years when he died of tuberculosis at the age of 25. They were indifferently received in his lifetime, but his fame grew rapidly after his death. By the end of the century, he was placed in the canon of English literature, strongly influencing many writers of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; the Encyclopædia Britannica of 1888 called one ode “one of the final masterpieces”.\nKeats had a style “heavily loaded with sensualities”, notably in the series of odes. Typically of the Romantics, he accentuated extreme emotion through natural imagery. Today his poems and letters remain among the most popular and analysed in English literature – in particular “Ode to a Nightingale”, “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Sleep and Poetry” and the sonnet “On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer”.

An actuator converts such an input signal into the required form of mechanical energy. It is a type of transducer. In simple terms, it is a “mover”.\nAn actuator requires a control device (controlled by control signal) and a source of energy. The control signal is relatively low energy and may be electric voltage or current, pneumatic, or hydraulic fluid pressure, or even human power. In the electric, hydraulic, and pneumatic sense, it is a form of automation or automatic control.\nThe displacement achieved is commonly linear or rotational, as exemplified by linear motors and rotary motors, respectively. Rotary motion is more natural for small machines making large displacements. By means of a leadscrew, rotary motion can be adapted to function as a linear actuator (a linear motion, but not a linear motor).\nAnother broad classification of actuators separates them into two types: incremental-drive actuators and continuous-drive actuators. Stepper motors are one type of incremental-drive actuators. Examples of continuous-drive actuators include DC torque motors, induction motors, hydraulic and pneumatic motors, and piston-cylinder drives (rams).\nWikipedia\n\nExam Alerts\nsaa_exam_alerts\nKey words"},"Unsorted-Items/Ada-Lovelace":{"title":"Ada Lovelace","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nAugusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage’s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.\nAda Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and reformer Anne Isabella Milbanke. All Lovelace’s half-siblings, Lord Byron’s other children, were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever.  He died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother was anxious about her upbringing and promoted Ada’s interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father’s perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone and Michael Faraday, and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as “poetical science” and herself as an “Analyst (&amp; Metaphysician)“.\nWhen she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as “the father of computers”. She was in particular interested in Babbage’s work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him on 5 June 1833, when she and her mother attended one of Charles Babbage’s Saturday night soirées with their mutual friend, and Ada’s private tutor, Mary Somerville.\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by the military engineer Luigi Menabrea (later Prime Minister of Italy) about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of seven notes, simply called “Notes”.\nLovelace’s notes are important in the early history of computers, especially since the seventh one contained what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage’s personal notes from 1837 to 1840 contain the first programs for the engine. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of “poetical science” led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Alan-Turing":{"title":"Alan Turing","links":["artificial-intelligence"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nAlan Mathison Turing  (; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.\nBorn in London, Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated in maths from King’s College, Cambridge, and in 1938, earned a maths PhD from Princeton University. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain’s codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. He led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bomba method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.\nAfter the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman’s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, Turing was never fully recognised during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.\nTuring was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He accepted hormone treatment, a procedure commonly referred to as chemical castration, as an alternative to prison. Turing died on 7 June 1954, aged 41, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide, but the evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.\nFollowing a campaign in 2009, British prime minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology for “the appalling way [Turing] was treated”. Queen Elizabeth II granted a pardon in 2013.

It was originally developed by LinkedIn and later open-sourced as a part of the Apache Software Foundation. Kafka is designed to handle high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable streaming of data between systems or applications.\nKey Concepts of Apache Kafka\n\n\nTopics: Kafka organizes data into topics, which are similar to message queues. Each topic is a stream of records, where records are immutable and ordered by time.\n\n\nPartitions: Topics are divided into partitions, which are the basic unit of parallelism and scalability in Kafka. Each partition is an ordered, append-only log of records.\n\n\nProducers: Producers are applications or systems that publish data records to Kafka topics. Producers determine which topic and partition to publish records to.\n\n\nConsumers: Consumers are applications or systems that subscribe to topics and process data records. Each consumer reads data from one or more partitions in a topic.\n\n\nConsumer Groups: Consumers are organized into consumer groups, where each group consists of one or more consumers. Each partition in a topic is assigned to exactly one consumer within a consumer group.\n\n\nBrokers: Kafka runs as a distributed system across a cluster of servers called brokers. Brokers store data and handle data replication, partitioning, and serving client requests.\n\n\nZooKeeper: Kafka traditionally depends on Apache ZooKeeper for cluster coordination, configuration management, and leader election. However, recent versions of Kafka are moving towards removing this dependency.\n\n\nUse Cases of Apache Kafka\n\n\nReal-Time Data Processing: Kafka is commonly used for real-time analytics, monitoring, and event-driven architectures, where data needs to be processed and analyzed in real time.\n\n\nLog Aggregation: Kafka can be used to collect logs from various sources, such as web servers, applications, and devices, into centralized log storage for analysis and monitoring.\n\n\nMessaging Systems: Kafka can serve as a high-throughput, fault-tolerant messaging system for communication between microservices or distributed systems.\n\n\nChange Data Capture (CDC): Kafka can capture changes to data in databases and stream them to downstream systems for processing, replication, or analytics.\n\n\nStream Processing: Kafka Streams, a built-in library for stream processing, enables developers to build real-time applications that transform, enrich, and aggregate data streams.\n\n\nBenefits of Apache Kafka\n\n\nScalability: Kafka is horizontally scalable and can handle large volumes of data across distributed clusters of brokers.\n\n\nDurability: Kafka provides fault-tolerant data replication and persistence, ensuring that data is not lost even in the event of hardware failures.\n\n\nLow Latency: Kafka offers high throughput and low latency, making it suitable for real-time data processing and analytics.\n\n\nFlexibility: Kafka’s distributed and decentralized architecture makes it flexible and adaptable to various use cases and deployment scenarios.\n\n\nApache Kafka has become a foundational component in modern data architectures, enabling organizations to build scalable, real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Its versatility, scalability, and performance make it a popular choice for a wide range of use cases across industries."},"Unsorted-Items/Aplastic-Anemia":{"title":"Aplastic Anemia","links":["Unsorted-Items/Marie-Curie","tags/saa_exam_alerts"],"tags":["saa_exam_alerts"],"content":"Overview\n\nAplastic Anemia (AA) is a severe hematologic condition in which the body fails to make blood cells in sufficient numbers. Aplastic anemia is associated with cancer and various cancer syndromes. Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow by stem cells that reside there. Aplastic anemia causes a deficiency of all blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nIt occurs most frequently in people in their teens and twenties but is also common among the elderly. It can be caused by heredity, immune disease, or exposure to chemicals, drugs, or radiation. However, in about half of cases, the cause is unknown.\nAplastic anemia can be definitively diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy. Normal bone marrow has 30–70% blood stem cells, but in aplastic anemia, these cells are mostly gone and are replaced by fat.\nFirst-line treatment for aplastic anemia consists of immunosuppressive drugs—typically either anti-lymphocyte globulin or anti-thymocyte globulin—combined with corticosteroids, chemotherapy, and ciclosporin. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is also used, especially for patients under 30 years of age with a related, matched marrow donor.\nAplastic anemia is known to have caused the deaths of Marie Curie, Eleanor Roosevelt, Luana Reyes, and Molly Holzschlag.\nWikipedia\n\nExam Alerts\nsaa_exam_alerts\nKey words"},"Unsorted-Items/Apple-II":{"title":"Apple II","links":["Unsorted-Items/Steve-Wozniak"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nThe Apple II is an early personal computer that was created by Apple Inc.

It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta (the parent company of Facebook), and Microsoft.\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to produce and market Steve Wozniak’s Apple I personal computer. The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, the company’s internal problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs left Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones.\nIn 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy and entice Jobs’s return, it bought NeXT. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through several tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the “Think different” campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden its product portfolio.

It borders Serbia to the east, Montenegro to the southeast, and Croatia to the north and southwest. In the south it has a 20 kilometres (12 miles) long coast on the Adriatic Sea, with the town of Neum being its only access to the sea. Bosnia has a moderate continental climate with hot summers and cold, snowy winters. In the central and eastern regions, the geography is mountainous, in the northwest it is moderately hilly, and in the northeast it is predominantly flat. Herzegovina, the smaller, southern region, has a Mediterranean climate and is mostly mountainous. Sarajevo is the capital and the largest city.\nThe area has been inhabited since at least the Upper Paleolithic, but evidence suggests that during the Neolithic age, permanent human settlements were established, including those that belonged to the Butmir, Kakanj, and Vučedol cultures. After the arrival of the first Indo-Europeans, the area was populated by several Illyrian and Celtic civilizations. The ancestors of the South Slavic peoples that populate the area today arrived during the 6th through the 9th century. In the 12th century, the Banate of Bosnia was established; by the 14th century, this had evolved into the Kingdom of Bosnia. In the mid-15th century, it was annexed into the Ottoman Empire, under whose rule it remained until the late 19th century; the Ottomans brought Islam to the region. From the late 19th century until World War I, the country was annexed into the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. In the interwar period, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.  After World War II, it was granted full republic status in the newly formed Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1992, following the breakup of Yugoslavia, the republic proclaimed independence. This was followed by the Bosnian War, which lasted until late 1995 and ended with the signing of the Dayton Agreement.\nThe country is home to three main ethnic groups: Bosniaks are the largest group, Serbs the second-largest, and Croats the third-largest. Minorities include Jews, Roma, Albanians, Montenegrins, Ukrainians and Turks. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a bicameral legislature and a three-member presidency made up of one member from each of the three major ethnic groups. However, the central government’s power is highly limited, as the country is largely decentralized. It comprises two autonomous entities—the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska—and a third unit, the Brčko District, which is governed by its own local government.\nBosnia and Herzegovina is a developing country and ranks 74th in the Human Development Index. Its economy is dominated by industry and agriculture, followed by tourism and the service sector. Tourism has increased significantly in recent years. The country has a social-security and universal-healthcare system, and primary and secondary level education is free. It is a member of the UN, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the Partnership for Peace, and the Central European Free Trade Agreement; it is also a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean, established in July 2008. Bosnia and Herzegovina is an EU candidate country and has also been a candidate for NATO membership since April 2010.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Bus-(computing)":{"title":"Bus (computing)","links":["computer","Unsorted-Items/Central-Processing-Unit","Unsorted-Items/Computer-memory"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nIn computer architecture, a bus (historically also called data highway or databus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.\nIn most traditional computer architectures, the CPU and main memory tend to be tightly coupled, with the internal bus connecting the two being known as the system bus. In systems that include a cache, CPUs use high-performance system buses that operate at speeds greater than memory to communicate with memory. The internal bus (also known as the internal data bus, memory bus or system bus) connects internal components of a computer to the mother board. Local buses connect the CPU and memory to the expansion bus, which in turn connects the computer to peripherals. Bus systems such as the SATA ports in modern computers support multiple peripherals, allowing multiple hard drives to be connected without an expansion card.\nIn systems that have a similar architecture to multicomputers, but which communicate by buses instead of networks, the system bus is known as a front-side bus. In such systems, the expansion bus may not share any architecture with their host CPUs, instead supporting many different CPUs, as is the case with PCI. While the term “peripheral bus” is sometimes used to refer to all other buses apart from the system bus, the “expansion bus” has also been used to describe a third category of buses separate from the peripheral bus, which includes bus systems like PCI.\nEarly computer buses were parallel electrical wires with multiple hardware connections, but the term is now used for any physical arrangement that provides the same logical function as a parallel electrical busbar. Modern computer buses can use both parallel and bit serial connections, and can be wired in either a multidrop (electrical parallel) or daisy chain topology, or connected by switched hubs. Many modern CPUs also feature a second set of pins similar to those for communicating with memory—but able to operate with different speeds and protocols—to ensure that peripherals do not slow overall system performance. CPUs can also feature smart controllers to place the data directly in memory, a concept known as direct memory access. Low-performance bus systems have also been developed, such as the Universal Serial Bus (USB).\nGiven technological changes, the classical terms “system”, “expansion” and “peripheral” no longer have the same connotations. Other common categorization systems are based on the bus’s primary role, connecting devices internally or externally. However, many common modern bus systems can be used for both. SATA and the associated eSATA are one example of a system that would formerly be described as internal, while certain automotive applications use the primarily external IEEE 1394 in a fashion more similar to a system bus. Other examples, like InfiniBand and I²C were designed from the start to be used both internally and externally.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/C-programming-language":{"title":"C programming language","links":["Unsorted-Items/Central-Processing-Unit","Unsorted-Items/Operating-System"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nC (pronounced  – like the letter c) is a general-purpose computer programming language.

It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.\nA successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book The C programming language, co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language. C has been standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\nC is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.\nSince 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top two languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Cache-(computing)":{"title":"Cache (computing)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nIn computing, a cache (  KASH) is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere. A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot. Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store; thus, the more requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the system performs.\nTo be cost-effective, caches must be relatively small. Nevertheless, caches are effective in many areas of computing because typical computer applications access data with a high degree of locality of reference. Such access patterns exhibit temporal locality, where data is requested that has been recently requested, and spatial locality, where data is requested that is stored near data that has already been requested.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Central-Processing-Unit":{"title":"Central Processing Unit","links":["Unsorted-Items/Graphics-Processing-Unit","tags/saa_exam_alerts"],"tags":["saa_exam_alerts"],"content":"Overview\n\nA Central Processing Unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor, or just processor, is the most important processor in a given computer.

This role contrasts with that of external components, such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and specialized coprocessors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).\nThe form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic–logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory), decoding and execution (of instructions) by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers, and other components. Modern CPUs devote a lot of semiconductor area to caches and instruction-level parallelism to increase performance and to CPU modes to support operating systems and virtualization.\nMost modern CPUs are implemented on integrated circuit (IC) microprocessors, with one or more CPUs on a single IC chip. Microprocessor chips with multiple CPUs are called multi-core processors. The individual physical CPUs, called processor cores, can also be multithreaded to support CPU-level multithreading.\nAn IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory, peripheral interfaces, and other components of a computer; such integrated devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip (SoC).\nWikipedia\n\nExam Alerts\nsaa_exam_alerts\nKey words"},"Unsorted-Items/Chernobyl-Disaster":{"title":"Chernobyl Disaster","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nThe Chernobyl Disaster began on 26 April 1986 with the explosion of the No. 4 reactor of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR, close to the border with the Byelorussian SSR, in the Soviet Union. It is one of only two nuclear energy accidents rated at seven—the maximum severity—on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. The initial emergency response and subsequent mitigation efforts involved more than 500,000 personnel and cost an estimated 18 billion roubles—roughly US$68 billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation. It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history.\nThe accident occurred during a test of the steam turbine’s ability to power the emergency feedwater pumps in the event of a simultaneous loss of external power and coolant pipe rupture. Following an accidental drop in reactor power to near-zero, the operators restarted the reactor in preparation for the turbine test with a prohibited control rod configuration. Upon successful completion of the test, the reactor was then shut down for maintenance. Due to a variety of factors, this action resulted in a power surge at the base of the reactor which brought about the rupture of reactor components and the loss of coolant. This process led to steam explosions and a meltdown, which destroyed the containment building. This was followed by a reactor core fire which lasted until 4 May 1986, during which airborne radioactive contaminants were spread throughout the USSR and Europe. In response to the initial accident, a 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) radius exclusion zone was created 36 hours after the accident, from which approximately 49,000 people were evacuated, primarily from Pripyat. The exclusion zone was later increased to a radius of 30 kilometres (19 mi), from which an additional ~68,000 people were evacuated.\nFollowing the reactor explosion, which killed two engineers and severely burned two more, an emergency operation to put out the fires and stabilize the surviving reactor began, during which 237 workers were hospitalized, of whom 134 exhibited symptoms of acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Among those hospitalized, 28 died within the following three months. In the following 10 years, 14 more workers (9 of whom had been hospitalized with ARS) died of various causes mostly unrelated to radiation exposure. 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths were attributed to the disaster as of 2011. A United Nations committee found that to date fewer than 100 deaths have resulted from the fallout. Model predictions of the eventual total death toll in the coming decades vary. The most widely cited study conducted by the World Health Organization in 2006 predicted 9,000 cancer-related fatalities in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia.\nFollowing the disaster, Pripyat was abandoned and eventually replaced by the new purpose-built city of Slavutych. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus was built by December 1986. It reduced the spread of radioactive contamination from the wreckage and protected it from weathering. The confinement shelter also provided radiological protection for the crews of the undamaged reactors at the site, which were restarted in late 1986 and 1987. However, this containment structure was only intended to last for 30 years, and required considerable reinforcement in the early 2000s. The Shelter was heavily supplemented in 2017 by the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement, which was constructed around the old structure. This larger enclosure aims to enable the removal of both the sarcophagus and the reactor debris while containing the radioactive materials inside. Clean-up is scheduled for completion by 2065.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Complex-instruction-set-computer":{"title":"Complex instruction set computer","links":["Unsorted-Items/Reduced-instruction-set-computer"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nA Complex instruction set computer (CISC ) is a computer architecture in which single instructions can execute several low-level operations (such as a load from memory, an arithmetic operation, and a memory store) or are capable of multi-step operations or addressing modes within single instructions.

Besides storing opened programs and data being actively processed, computer memory serves as mass storage cache and write buffer to improve both reading and writing performance. Operating systems borrow RAM capacity for caching so long as not needed by running software. If needed, contents of the computer memory can be transferred to storage; a common way of doing this is through a memory management technique called virtual memory.\nModern computer memory is implemented as semiconductor memory, where data is stored within memory cells built from MOS transistors and other components on an integrated circuit. There are two main kinds of semiconductor memory: volatile and non-volatile. Examples of non-volatile memory are flash memory and ROM, PROM, EPROM and EEPROM memory. Examples of volatile memory are dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) used for primary storage, and static random-access memory (SRAM) used mainly for CPU cache.\nMost semiconductor memory is organized into memory cells each storing one bit (0 or 1). Flash memory organization includes both one bit per memory cell and multi-level cell capable of storing multiple bits per cell. The memory cells are grouped into words of fixed word length, for example, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 bits.

With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union, following the Latin and Greek alphabets.\nThe Early Cyrillic alphabet was developed during the 9th century AD at the Preslav Literary School in the First Bulgarian Empire during the reign of Tsar Simeon I the Great, probably by the  disciples of the two Byzantine brothers Cyril and Methodius, who had previously created the Glagolitic script. Among them were Clement of Ohrid, Naum of Preslav, Angelar, Sava and other scholars.

Revolutionary activity lasted about eight days, involving mass demonstrations and violent armed clashes with police and gendarmes, the last loyal forces of the Russian monarchy. On 27 February O.S. (12 March N.S.), the forces of the capital’s garrison sided with the revolutionaries. Three days later, Nicholas II abdicated, ending Romanov dynastic rule. The Russian Provisional Government under Georgy Lvov replaced the Council of Ministers of Russia.\nThe Provisional Government proved deeply unpopular and was forced to share dual power with the Petrograd Soviet. After the July Days, in which the government killed hundreds of protesters, Alexander Kerensky became the head of the government. He was unable to resolve Russia’s immediate problems, including food shortages and mass unemployment, as he attempted to keep Russia involved in the ever more unpopular world war. The failures of the Provisional Government led to the October Revolution by the communist Bolsheviks later that year. The February Revolution had weakened the country; the October Revolution broke it, resulting in the Russian Civil War and the eventual formation of the Soviet Union.\nThe revolution appeared to have broken out without any real leadership or formal planning. Russia had been suffering from a number of economic and social problems, which compounded after the start of World War I in 1914. Disaffected soldiers from the city’s garrison joined bread rioters, primarily women in bread lines, and industrial strikers on the streets. As more and more troops of the undisciplined garrison of the capital deserted, and with loyal troops away at the Eastern Front, the city fell into chaos, leading to the Tsar’s decision to abdicate under his generals’ advice. In all, over 1,300 people were killed during the protests of February 1917. The historiographical reasons for the revolution have varied. Russian historians writing during the time of the Soviet Union cited the anger of the proletariat against the bourgeois boiling over as the cause. Russian liberals cited World War I. Revisionists tracked it back to land disputes after the serf era. Modern historians cite a combination of these factors and criticize mythologization of the event.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/File-Allocation-Table":{"title":"File Allocation Table","links":["Unsorted-Items/MS-DOS","Information-Technology/Operating-Systems/Windows/Windows","Unsorted-Items/Floppy-Disk","Unsorted-Items/New-Technology-File-System","Unsorted-Items/Windows-XP"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nFile Allocation Table (FAT) is a file system developed for personal computers and was the default filesystem for MS-DOS and Windows 9x operating systems.

This position is indicated by the exponent, so floating point can be considered a form of scientific notation.\nA floating-point system can be used to represent, with a fixed number of digits, numbers of very different orders of magnitude — such as the number of meters between galaxies or between protons in an atom.  For this reason, floating-point arithmetic is often used to allow very small and very large real numbers that require fast processing times.  The result of this dynamic range is that the numbers that can be represented are not uniformly spaced; the difference between two consecutive representable numbers varies with their exponent.\nOver the years, a variety of floating-point representations have been used in computers.  In 1985, the IEEE 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic was established, and since the 1990s, the most commonly encountered representations are those defined by the IEEE.\nThe speed of floating-point operations, commonly measured in terms of FLOPS, is an important characteristic of a computer system, especially for applications that involve intensive mathematical calculations.\nA floating-point unit (FPU, colloquially a math coprocessor) is a part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations on floating-point numbers.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Floppy-Disk":{"title":"Floppy Disk","links":["Unsorted-Items/IBM"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nA Floppy Disk or floppy diskette (casually referred to as a floppy or a diskette) is a type of disk storage composed of a thin and flexible disk of a magnetic storage medium in a square or nearly square plastic enclosure lined with a fabric that removes dust particles from the spinning disk.

The killing of the Archduke and his wife set off the July Crisis, a chain of events that within one month led to the outbreak of World War I.\nPrincip was born in western Bosnia to a poor Serb family. At the age of 13, he was sent to Sarajevo, the capital of Austrian-occupied Bosnia, to study at the Merchants’ School, before transferring to the gymnasium, where he became politically aware. In 1911, he joined Young Bosnia, a secret local society aiming to free Bosnia from Austrian rule and achieve the unification of the South Slavs. After attending anti-Austrian demonstrations in Sarajevo, he was expelled from school and walked to Belgrade, Serbia to continue his education. During the First Balkan War, Princip traveled to Southern Serbia to volunteer with the Serbian army’s irregular forces fighting against the Ottoman Empire but was rejected for being too small and weak.\nIn 1913, following the unexpected success of the Serbians in the war against the Ottomans, the Austrian military governor of Bosnia, Oskar Potiorek, declared a state of emergency, dissolved the parliament, imposed martial rule, and banned all Serbian public, cultural, and educational societies. Inspired by a spate of assassination attempts against Imperial officials by Slavic nationalists and anarchists, Princip convinced two other young Bosnians to join a plot to assassinate the heir to the Habsburg Empire during his announced visit to Sarajevo. The Black Hand, a Serbian secret society with ties to Serbian military intelligence, provided the conspirators with weapons and training before facilitating their re-entry into Bosnia.\nOn Sunday 28 June 1914 during the royal couple’s visit to Sarajevo, the then-teenager Princip mortally wounded both Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie by firing a pistol into their convertible car that had unexpectedly stopped 5 feet (1.5 m) from him. Princip was arrested immediately and tried alongside twenty-four others, all Bosnians and thus Austro-Hungarian subjects. At his trial, Princip stated: “I am a Yugoslav nationalist, aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, and I do not care what form of state, but it must be free from Austria.” Princip was spared the death penalty because of his age (19) and sentenced to twenty years in prison. He was imprisoned at the Terezín fortress. The Serbian government itself did not inspire the assassination but the Austrian Foreign Office and Army used the murders as a reason for a preventive war which led directly to World War I.\nPrincip died on 28 April 1918 from tuberculosis exacerbated by poor prison conditions which had already caused one of his arms to be amputated.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Genomics":{"title":"Genomics","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nGenomics is an interdisciplinary field of molecular biology focusing on the structure, function, evolution, mapping, and editing of genomes.

Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s, the subsequent commercialization in the 1990s and beyond incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.\nMost traditional communication media, including telephone, radio, television, paper mail, and newspapers, are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email, Internet telephone, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing have adapted to website technology or have been reshaped into blogging, web feeds, and online news aggregators. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interaction through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking services. Online shopping has grown exponentially for major retailers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their “brick and mortar” presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online. Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries.\nThe Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. The overarching definitions of the two principal name spaces on the Internet, the Internet Protocol address (IP address) space and the Domain Name System (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. In November 2006, the Internet was included on USA Today’s list of the New Seven Wonders.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Jeopardy-Wrongs":{"title":"Jeopardy Wrongs","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nThe lyrics to the Macarena\nArthur C Clark Wrote 2001, the book\nPretty much everything about baseball\nPresedential homes\nDragon boat\nBlain\nPEru flag\nCatch-22 major major\npelican brief\nmadasgascar\nparadigm\nempircism\nparpatetitc\nfeckened\nsamuel tildon\nonly angels have wings movie\noscar peterson\nvirginia wolf’s real name\nwainwright\nthe white sea\nceetin sea\nprovost\nbessy smith\nsatnav\ncuneiform\napocaryphal\nhumbleness\nindus country\njohn updyke\nroslind franklin\nlanstriner\nterry pratchet\nwilliam falkner\nmalta\nctacinbs\nlil bo peep\nold mother hubbard\nbanana rupublic og name\nanton st exhuberan\nfrench quarer name\nFez (jew quarter)\nGilgamesh\nolympics histories\nconastoga wagon\nnorthwest territory\ncontemporaries definition\nproxima centuri\nthe master and margarita\nCotton Mather\nFirst Bank of the United States\n\n"},"Unsorted-Items/John-Williams-(author)":{"title":"John Williams (author)","links":["tags/saa_exam_alerts"],"tags":["saa_exam_alerts"],"content":"Overview\nExam Alerts\nsaa_exam_alerts\nKey words"},"Unsorted-Items/Joseph-Stalin":{"title":"Joseph Stalin","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nJoseph Vissarionovich Stalin (born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili; 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878 – 5 March 1953) was a Soviet revolutionary and politician who was the longest-serving leader of the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953. He held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922–1952) and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union (1941–1953). Stalin initially governed the country as part of a collective leadership before consolidating power to become a dictator by the 1930s. Stalin coined the term Marxism–Leninism to outline his Leninist interpretation of Marxism, also known as Stalinism.\nBorn into a poor family in Gori in what was then the Russian Empire, Stalin attended the Tbilisi Spiritual Seminary before joining the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He edited the party’s newspaper, Pravda, and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin’s Bolshevik faction as a gangster via robberies, kidnappings and protection rackets. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles to Siberia. After the Bolsheviks seized power in the October Revolution and created a one-party state under the new Communist Party in 1917, Stalin joined its governing Politburo. Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union’s establishment in 1922, Stalin assumed leadership over the country following Lenin’s death in 1924. Under Stalin, socialism in one country became a central tenet of the party’s ideology. As a result of his Five-Year Plans, the country underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation, creating a centralised command economy. Severe disruptions to food production contributed to the famine of 1930–33, including the Asharshylyk in Kazakhstan and the Holodomor in Ukraine. To eradicate those deemed “enemies of the working class”, Stalin instituted the Great Purge, in which over a million were imprisoned, largely in the Gulag system of forced labour camps, and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had absolute control over the party and government.\nStalin promoted Marxism–Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements during the 1930s, particularly in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, his regime signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, resulting in the Soviet invasion of Poland. Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941. Despite huge losses, the Soviet Red Army repelled the German invasion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. Amid the war, the Soviets annexed the Baltic states and Bessarabia and North Bukovina, subsequently establishing Soviet-aligned governments throughout Central and Eastern Europe and in parts of East Asia. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as global superpowers and entered a period of tension, the Cold War. Stalin presided over the Soviet post-war reconstruction and its development of an atomic bomb in 1949. During these years, the country experienced another major famine and an antisemitic campaign that culminated in the doctors’ plot. After Stalin’s death in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who subsequently denounced his rule and initiated the de-Stalinisation of Soviet society.\nWidely considered to be one of the 20th century’s most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist–Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and socialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who cemented the Soviet Union’s status as a leading world power. Conversely, his totalitarian regime has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repression, ethnic cleansing, pervasive censorship, wide-scale deportation, hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines that killed millions.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Karl-Marx":{"title":"Karl Marx","links":["Unsorted-Items/The-Communist-Manifesto","Unsorted-Items/Friedrich-Engels"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nKarl Marx (German: [maʁks]; 5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German-born philosopher, economist, political theorist, historian, sociologist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. His best-known works are the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto (with Friedrich Engels) and the three-volume Das Kapital (1867–1894); the latter employs his critical approach of historical materialism in an analysis of capitalism and is the culmination of his intellectual efforts. Marx’s ideas and theories and their subsequent development, collectively known as Marxism, have exerted enormous influence on modern intellectual, economic and political history.\nBorn in Trier in the Kingdom of Prussia, Marx studied at the universities of Bonn, Berlin, and Jena, and received a doctorate in philosophy from the latter in 1841. A Young Hegelian, he was influenced by the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and both critiqued and developed Hegel’s ideas in works such as The German Ideology (written 1846) and the Grundrisse (written 1857–1858). While in Paris in 1844, Marx wrote his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts and met Engels, a lifelong friend and collaborator. After moving to Brussels in 1845, they were active in the Communist League, and in 1848 wrote The Communist Manifesto, which expresses Marx’s ideas and lays out a programme for revolution. Marx was expelled from Belgium and Germany, and in 1849 moved to London, where he wrote The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852) and Das Kapital. In 1864, Marx helped found the International Workingmen’s Association (First International), in which he sought to fight the influence of anarchists led by Mikhail Bakunin. In his Critique of the Gotha Programme (1875), Marx wrote on revolution, the state and the transition to communism. He died stateless in 1883 and was buried in Highgate Cemetery.\nMarx’s critiques of history, society and political economy hold that human societies develop through class conflict. In the capitalist mode of production, this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and the working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing his historical materialist approach, Marx predicted that capitalism produced internal tensions like previous socioeconomic systems and that these tensions would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as the socialist mode of production. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism—owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature—would eventuate the working class’s development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised proletarian revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.\nMarx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and his work has been both lauded and criticised. Marxism has exerted major influence on socialist thought and political movements, and during the 20th century revolutionary governments identifying as Marxist took power in many countries and established socialist states including the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China. A number of theoretical variants such as Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, and Maoism have been developed. Marx’s work in economics has a strong influence on modern heterodox theories of labour and its relation to capital, and he is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Kubernetes":{"title":"Kubernetes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nKubernetes (, K8s) is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management.

He was a central figure in the 1905 Revolution, October Revolution, Russian Civil War, and the establishment of the Soviet Union. Alongside Vladimir Lenin, Trotsky was widely considered the most prominent Soviet figure and was de facto second-in-command during the early years of the Russian Soviet Republic. Ideologically a Marxist and a Leninist, his thought and writings inspired a school of Marxism known as Trotskyism.\nBorn into a wealthy Jewish family in Yanovka in what was then the Russian Empire, Trotsky was initially a narodnik, but embraced Marxism soon after moving to Nikolayev in 1896. In 1898, he was arrested for revolutionary activities and exiled to Siberia, but in 1902 escaped to London, where he met Lenin and wrote for the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party’s paper Iskra. Trotsky initially sided with Julius Martov’s Mensheviks against Lenin’s Bolsheviks during the party’s 1903 split, but was non-factional from 1904. During the 1905 Revolution, Trotsky returned to Russia and became chairman of the Saint Petersburg Soviet. He was again exiled to Siberia, but escaped in 1907 and spent time in London, Vienna, Switzerland, Paris, and New York. After the February Revolution of 1917, which overthrew the tsar, Trotsky returned to Russia and joined the Bolsheviks. As chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, he played an important role in the October Revolution that overthrew the Provisional Government.\nIn Lenin’s first government, Trotsky was appointed the People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs and led the negotiations for the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, by which Russia withdrew from World War I. From 1918 to 1925, he served as the People’s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs, founding the Red Army; establishing conscription, training, and discipline; and leading it to victory in the Russian Civil War. In 1922, Trotsky and Lenin formed an alliance against the emerging Soviet bureaucracy; Lenin proposed that Trotsky become his Deputy Chairman and preside over economic management at the Council of People’s Commissars, but he declined the post.\nDuring the New Economic Policy, Trotsky led the party’s Left Opposition, which advocated a programme of rapid industrialisation, voluntary collectivisation of agriculture, and expansion of workers’ democracy. After Lenin’s death in 1924, Trotsky was outmaneuvered by Joseph Stalin and his allies and lost his positions: he was expelled from the Politburo in 1926 and from the party in 1927, internally exiled to Alma Ata in 1928, and deported in 1929. He lived in Turkey, France, and Norway before settling in Mexico in 1937.\nIn exile, Trotsky wrote extensively and polemically against Stalinism, supporting proletarian internationalism against Stalin’s theory of “socialism in one country”. Trotsky’s own theory of “permanent revolution” posited that the revolution could only survive if extended to advanced capitalist countries. In The Revolution Betrayed (1936), Trotsky argued that the Soviet Union had become a “degenerated workers’ state” due to its isolation, and called for an end to Stalin’s bureaucratic dictatorship. He founded the Fourth International in 1938 as an alternative to the Comintern. In 1936, Trotsky was sentenced to death in absentia at the first of the Moscow show trials, and in 1940, he was assassinated at his home in Mexico City by NKVD agent Ramón Mercader.\nWritten out of Soviet history books under Stalin, Trotsky was one of the few of his rivals who never received political rehabilitation from later leaders. In the Western world, he emerged as a hero of the anti-Stalinist left for his defense of a more democratic, internationalist form of socialism  against Stalinist totalitarianism and intellectual contributions to left-wing movements. Whilst some of his wartime measures have proved controversial and have been criticised along with his ideological defence of the Red Terror, modern scholarship generally ranks his leadership of the Red Army highly among historical figures and he is credited for his major involvement with the military, economic, cultural and political development of the Soviet Union.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Local-bus":{"title":"Local bus","links":["central-processing-unit"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nIn computer architecture, a Local bus is a computer bus that connects directly, or almost directly, from  the central processing unit (CPU) to one or more slots on the expansion bus.

There are several local buses built into various types of computers to increase the speed of data transfer (i.e. bandwidth). Local buses for expanded memory and video boards are the most common. VESA Local Bus and Processor Direct Slot were examples of a local bus design.\nAlthough VL-Bus was later succeeded by AGP, it is not correct to categorize AGP as a local bus.

Collectively, MS-DOS, its rebranding as IBM PC DOS, and a few operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS, are sometimes referred to as “DOS” (which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system). MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatibles during the 1980s, from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system.\nIBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs. Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM, the two products diverged after twelve years, in 1993, with recognizable differences in compatibility, syntax and capabilities.\nBeginning in 1988 with DR-DOS, several competing products were released for the x86 platform, and MS-DOS went through eight versions, until development ceased in 2000. Initially, MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system, but application software and user data as well. Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats, along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures. Ultimately, it was the key product in Microsoft’s development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm, providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources. It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Macintosh-System-Software":{"title":"Macintosh System Software","links":["Unsorted-Items/Macintosh"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nMac OS (originally System Software; retronym: Classic Mac OS) is the series of operating systems developed for the Macintosh family of personal computers by Apple Computer, Inc. from 1984 to 2001, starting with System 1 and ending with Mac OS 9. The Macintosh operating system is credited with having popularized the graphical user interface concept. It was included with every Macintosh that was sold during the era in which it was developed, and many updates to the system software were done in conjunction with the introduction of new Macintosh systems.\nApple released the original Macintosh on January 24, 1984. The first version of the system software, which had no official name, was partially based on the Lisa OS, which Apple previously released for the Lisa computer in 1983. As part of an agreement allowing Xerox to buy shares in Apple at a favorable price, it also used concepts from the Xerox PARC Alto computer, which former Apple CEO Steve Jobs and other Lisa team members had previewed. This operating system consisted of the Macintosh Toolbox ROM and the “System Folder”, a set of files that were loaded from disk. The name Macintosh System Software came into use in 1987 with System 5. Apple rebranded the system as Mac OS in 1996, starting officially with version 7.6, due in part to its Macintosh clone program. That program ended after the release of Mac OS 8 in 1997. The last major release of the system was Mac OS 9 in 1999.\nInitial versions of the System Software ran one application at a time. With the Macintosh 512K, a system extension called the Switcher was developed to use this additional memory to allow multiple programs to remain loaded. The software of each loaded program used the memory exclusively; only when activated by the Switcher did the program appear, even the Finder’s desktop. With the Switcher, the now familiar Clipboard feature allowed copy and paste between the loaded programs across switches including the desktop.\nWith the introduction of System 5, a cooperative multitasking extension called MultiFinder was added, which allowed content in windows of each program to remain in a layered view over the desktop, and was later integrated into System 7 as part of the operating system along with support for virtual memory. By the mid-1990s, however, contemporary operating systems such as Windows NT, OS/2, NeXTSTEP, BSD, and Linux had all brought pre-emptive multitasking, protected memory, access controls, and multi-user capabilities to desktop computers. The Macintosh’s limited memory management and susceptibility to conflicts among extensions that provide additional functionality, such as networking or support for a particular device, led to significant criticism of the operating system, and was a factor in Apple’s declining market share at the time.\nAfter two aborted attempts at creating a successor to the Macintosh System Software called Taligent and Copland, and a four-year development effort spearheaded by Steve Jobs’s return to Apple in 1997, Apple replaced Mac OS with a new operating system in 2001 named Mac OS X. It retained most of the user interface design elements of the Classic Mac OS, and there was some overlap of application frameworks for compatibility, but the two operating systems otherwise have completely different origins and architectures.\nThe final updates to Mac OS 9 released in 2001 provided interoperability with Mac OS X. The name “Classic” that now signifies the historical Mac OS as a whole is a reference to the Classic Environment, a compatibility layer that helped ease the transition to Mac OS X (now macOS).\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Macintosh-operating-system":{"title":"Macintosh operating system","links":["Unsorted-Items/Macintosh-System-Software"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nTwo major families of Mac operating systems were developed by Apple Inc.\nIn 1984, Apple debuted the operating system that is now known as the “Classic” Mac OS with its release of the original Macintosh System Software. The system, rebranded “Mac OS” in 1997, was pre-installed on every Macintosh until 2002 and offered on Macintosh clones for a short time in the 1990s. It was noted for its ease of use, and also criticized for its lack of modern technologies compared to its competitors.\nThe current Mac operating system is macOS, originally named “Mac OS X” until 2012 and then “OS X” until 2016. It was developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple’s purchase of NeXT. It brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP, a Unix system, that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced, such as problems with memory management. The current macOS is pre-installed with every Mac and receives a major update annually. It is the basis of Apple’s current system software for its other devices – iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.\nPrior to the introduction of Mac OS X, Apple experimented with several other concepts, releasing different products designed to bring the Macintosh interface or applications to Unix-like systems or vice versa, A/UX, MAE, and MkLinux. Apple’s effort to expand upon and develop a replacement for its classic Mac OS in the 1990s led to a few cancelled projects, code named Star Trek, Taligent, and Copland.\nAlthough the classic Mac OS and macOS (Mac OS X) have different architectures, they share a common set of GUI principles, including a menu bar across the top of the screen; the Finder shell, featuring a desktop metaphor that represents files and applications using icons and relates concepts like directories and file deletion to real-world objects like folders and a trash can; and overlapping windows for multitasking.\nBefore the arrival of the Macintosh in 1984, Apple’s history of operating systems began with its Apple II series computers in 1977, which ran Apple DOS, ProDOS, and later GS/OS; the Apple III in 1980, which ran Apple SOS; and the Apple Lisa in 1983, which ran Lisa OS and later MacWorks XL, a Macintosh emulator. Apple also developed the Newton OS for its Newton personal digital assistant from 1993 to 1997.\nIn recent years, Apple has also launched several new operating systems based on the core of macOS, including iOS in 2007 for its iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch mobile devices and in 2017 for its HomePod smart speakers; watchOS in 2015 for the Apple Watch; tvOS in 2015 for the Apple TV set-top box.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Macintosh":{"title":"Macintosh","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nThe Mac, short for Macintosh (its official name until 1999), is a family of personal computers designed and marketed by Apple.

She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. Her husband, Pierre Curie, was a co-winner of her first Nobel Prize, making them the first-ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was, in 1906, the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.\nShe was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw’s clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. In 1895 she married the French physicist Pierre Curie, and she shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with him and with the physicist Henri Becquerel for their pioneering work developing the theory of “radioactivity”—a term she coined. In 1906 Pierre Curie died in a Paris street accident. Marie won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements polonium and radium, using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes. Under her direction, the world’s first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms by the use of radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institute in Paris in 1920, and the Curie Institute in Warsaw in 1932; both remain major medical research centres. During World War I she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.\nWhile a French citizen, Marie Skłodowska Curie, who used both surnames, never lost her sense of Polish identity. She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland. She named the first chemical element she discovered polonium, after her native country. Marie Curie died in 1934, aged 66, at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy (Haute-Savoie), France, of aplastic anemia likely from exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research and in the course of her radiological work at field hospitals during World War I. In addition to her Nobel Prizes, she received numerous other honours and tributes; in 1995 she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Paris Panthéon, and Poland declared 2011 the Year of Marie Curie during the International Year of Chemistry.

The Mensheviks were led by Julius Martov and Pavel Axelrod.\nThe initial point of disagreement was the Mensheviks’ support for a broad party membership, as opposed to the Bolsheviks’ support for a smaller party of professional revolutionaries. The Bolsheviks gained a majority on the Central Committee in 1903, though the power of the two factions fluctuated in the following years. Mensheviks came to be associated with the position that a bourgeois-democratic revolution and period of capitalism would need to occur before the conditions for a socialist revolution emerged. In 1912, the RSDLP formally split into Bolshevik and Menshevik parties. The Mensheviks further split over World War I and the Russian Provisional Government, which the party supported by entering a coalition with the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the liberal Constitutional Democrats.\nIn the 1917 election to the Constituent Assembly, the Mensheviks received about 3 percent of the vote, compared to the Bolsheviks’ 23 percent.

Starting with Windows NT 3.1, it is the default file system of the Windows NT family. It superseded File Allocation Table (FAT) as the preferred filesystem on Windows and is supported in Linux and BSD as well. NTFS reading and writing support is provided using a free and open-source kernel implementation known as NTFS3 in Linux and the NTFS-3G driver in BSD. By using the convert command, Windows can convert FAT32/16/12 into NTFS without the need to rewrite all files. NTFS uses several files typically hidden from the user to store metadata about other files stored on the drive which can help improve speed and performance when reading data. Unlike FAT and High Performance File System (HPFS), NTFS supports access control lists (ACLs), filesystem encryption, transparent compression, sparse files and file system journaling. NTFS also supports shadow copy to allow backups of a system while it is running, but the functionality of the shadow copies varies between different versions of Windows.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/October-Revolution":{"title":"October Revolution","links":["Unsorted-Items/Vladimir-Lenin","Unsorted-Items/February-Revolution"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nThe October Revolution, also known as the Great October Socialist Revolution (in Soviet historiography), October coup, or Bolshevik coup was a revolution in Russia led by the Bolshevik Party of Vladimir Lenin that was a key moment in the larger Russian Revolution of 1917–1923. It was the second revolutionary change of government in Russia in 1917. It took place through an armed insurrection in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) on 7 November 1917 [O.S. 25 October]. It was the precipitating event of the Russian Civil War.\nThe October Revolution followed and capitalized on the February Revolution earlier that year, which led to the abdication of Nicholas II and the creation of a provisional government. The provisional government, led by Alexander Kerensky, had taken power after Grand Duke Michael, the younger brother of Nicholas II, declined to take power. During this time, urban workers began to organize into councils (soviets) wherein revolutionaries criticized the provisional government and its actions. The provisional government remained unpopular, especially because it was continuing to fight in World War I, and had ruled with an iron fist throughout the summer (including killing hundreds of protesters in the July Days).\nEvents came to a head in the fall as the Directorate, led by the left-wing Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries (SRs), controlled the government. The far-left Bolsheviks were deeply unhappy with the government, and began spreading calls for a military uprising. On 10 October 1917 (O.S.; 23 October, N.S.), the Petrograd Soviet, led by Trotsky, voted to back a military uprising. On 24 October (O.S.; 6 November, N.S.) the government shut down numerous newspapers and closed the city of Petrograd in an attempt to forestall the revolution; minor armed skirmishes broke out. The next day a full scale uprising erupted as a fleet of Bolshevik sailors entered the harbor and tens of thousands of soldiers rose up in support of the Bolsheviks. Bolshevik Red Guards forces under the Military-Revolutionary Committee began the occupation of government buildings on 25 October (O.S.; 7 November, N.S.), 1917. The following day, the Winter Palace (the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capital of Russia) was captured.\nAs the Revolution was not universally recognized, the country descended into the Russian Civil War, which would last until 1923 and ultimately lead to the creation of the Soviet Union in late 1922. The historiography of the event has varied. The victorious Soviet Union viewed it as a validation of their ideology, and the triumph of the worker over capitalism. During Soviet times, revolution day was a national holiday, marking its importance in the country’s founding story. On the other hand, the Western Allies saw it as a totalitarian coup, which used the democratic Soviet councils only until they were no longer useful. The event inspired many cultural works, and ignited communist movements across Europe and globally. Many Marxist–Leninist parties around the world celebrate October Revolution Day.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Operating-System":{"title":"Operating System","links":["Information-Technology/Operating-Systems/Windows/Windows","Information-Technology/Operating-Systems/macOS/macOS","Unsorted-Items/iOS","Unsorted-Items/iPadOS"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nAn Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.\nTime-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, peripherals, and other resources.\nFor hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it.

The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus but in a standardized format that is independent of any given processor’s native bus. Devices connected to the PCI bus appear to a bus master to be connected directly to its own bus and are assigned addresses in the processor’s address space. It is a parallel bus, synchronous to a single bus clock.\nAttached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard (called a planar device in the PCI specification) or an expansion card that fits into a slot. The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles, where it displaced the combination of several slow Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) slots and one fast VESA Local Bus (VLB) slot as the bus configuration. It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types. Typical PCI cards used in PCs include: network cards, sound cards, modems, extra ports such as Universal Serial Bus (USB) or serial, TV tuner cards and hard disk drive host adapters. PCI video cards replaced ISA and VLB cards until rising bandwidth needs outgrew the abilities of PCI. The preferred interface for video cards then became Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP), a superset of PCI, before giving way to PCI Express.\nThe first version of PCI found in retail desktop computers was a 32-bit bus using a 33 MHz bus clock and 5 V signaling, although the PCI 1.0 standard provided for a 64-bit variant as well. These have one locating notch in the card. Version 2.0 of the PCI standard introduced 3.3 V slots, physically distinguished by a flipped physical connector to prevent accidental insertion of 5 V cards. Universal cards, which can operate on either voltage, have two notches. Version 2.1 of the PCI standard introduced optional 66 MHz operation. A server-oriented variant of PCI, PCI Extended (PCI-X) operated at frequencies up to 133 MHz for PCI-X 1.0 and up to 533 MHz for PCI-X 2.0. An internal connector for laptop cards, called Mini PCI, was introduced in version 2.2 of the PCI specification. The PCI bus was also adopted for an external laptop connector standard –  the CardBus. The first PCI specification was developed by Intel, but subsequent development of the standard became the responsibility of the PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG).\nPCI and PCI-X sometimes are referred to as either Parallel PCI or Conventional PCI to distinguish them technologically from their more recent successor PCI Express, which adopted a serial, lane-based architecture. PCI’s heyday in the desktop computer market was approximately 1995 to 2005. PCI and PCI-X have become obsolete for most purposes and has largely disappeared from many other modern motherboards since 2013; however they are still common on some modern desktops as of 2020 for the purposes of backward compatibility and the relative low cost to produce. Another common modern application of parallel PCI is in industrial PCs, where many specialized expansion cards, used here, never transitioned to PCI Express, just as with some ISA cards. Many kinds of devices formerly available on PCI expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in USB and PCI Express versions.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Personal-Computer":{"title":"Personal Computer","links":["Unsorted-Items/MS-DOS","Unsorted-Items/Apple,-Inc.","Information-Technology/Operating-Systems/macOS/macOS"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nA Personal Computer, often referred to as a PC, is a computer designed for individual use.

The advent of personal computers and the concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of people in all countries.\nInstitutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with computers. While personal computer users may develop their applications, usually these systems run commercial software, free-of-charge software (“freeware”), which is most often proprietary, or free and open-source software, which is provided in “ready-to-run”, or binary form. Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers. Many personal computer users no longer need to write their programs to make any use of a personal computer, although end-user programming is still feasible. This contrasts with mobile systems, where software is often available only through a manufacturer-supported channel, and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer.\nSince the early 1990s, Microsoft operating systems (first with MS-DOS and then with Windows) and Intel hardware – collectively called “Wintel” – have dominated the personal computer market, and today the term “PC” normally refers to the ubiquitous Wintel platform.

Compared to the instructions given to a complex instruction set computer (CISC), a RISC computer might require more instructions (more code) in order to accomplish a task because the individual instructions are written in simpler code. The goal is to offset the need to process more instructions by increasing the speed of each instruction, in particular by implementing an instruction pipeline, which may be simpler to achieve given simpler instructions.\nThe key operational concept of the RISC computer is that each instruction performs only one function (e.g. copy a value from memory to a register). The RISC computer usually has many (16 or 32) high-speed, general-purpose registers with a load–store architecture in which the code for the register-register instructions (for performing arithmetic and tests) are separate from the instructions that grant access to the main memory of the computer. The design of the CPU allows RISC computers few simple addressing modes and predictable instruction times that simplify design of the system as a whole.\nThe conceptual developments of the RISC computer architecture began with the IBM 801 project in the late 1970s, but these were not immediately put into use. Designers in California picked up the 801 concepts in two seminal projects, Stanford MIPS and Berkeley RISC. These were commercialized in the 1980s as the MIPS and SPARC systems. IBM eventually produced RISC designs based on further work on the 801 concept, the IBM POWER architecture, PowerPC, and Power ISA. As the projects matured, many similar designs, produced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, created the central processing units that increased the commercial utility of the Unix workstation and of embedded processors in the laser printer, the router, and similar products.\nIn the minicomputer market, companies that included Celerity Computing, Pyramid Technology, and Ridge Computers began offering systems designed according to RISC or RISC-like principles in the early 1980s. Few of these designs began by using RISC microprocessors.\nThe varieties of RISC processor design include the ARC processor, DEC Alpha, the AMD Am29000, the ARM architecture, the Atmel AVR, Blackfin, Intel i860, Intel i960, LoongArch, Motorola 88000, the MIPS architecture, PA-RISC, Power ISA, RISC-V, SuperH, and SPARC.

It was a successor state to the Russian Empire that was nominally organized as a federal union of fifteen national republics, the largest and most populous of which was the Russian SFSR; in practice both its government and economy were highly centralized until its final years. As a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, it was a flagship communist state.\nThe Soviet Union’s roots lay in the October Revolution of 1917, which saw the Bolsheviks overthrow the Russian Provisional Government that formed earlier that year following the February Revolution that had dissolved the Russian Empire. The new government, led by Vladimir Lenin, established the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), the world’s first constitutionally socialist state. The revolution was not accepted by all within the Russian Republic, resulting in the Russian Civil War between the Bolsheviks and the anti-communist Whites. As the war progressed in the Bolsheviks’ favor, the RSFSR began to incorporate land acquired from the war into various puppet states, which were merged into the Soviet Union in December 1922. Following Lenin’s death in 1924, Joseph Stalin came to power, inaugurating a period of rapid industrialization and forced collectivization that led to significant economic growth, but also contributed to a famine in 1930 to 1933 that killed millions. The forced labour camp system of the Gulag was also expanded in this period. During the late 1930s, Stalin conducted the Great Purge to remove actual and perceived opponents, resulting in mass death, imprisonment, and deportation. In 1939, the USSR and Nazi Germany signed a nonaggression pact despite their ideological incongruence; nonetheless, in 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the largest land invasion in history, opening the Eastern Front of World War II. The Soviets played a decisive role in defeating the Axis powers in 1945, suffering an estimated 27 million casualties, which accounted for the majority of Allied losses. In the aftermath of the war, the Soviet Union consolidated the territory occupied by the Red Army, forming various satellite states, and undertook rapid economic development which cemented its status as a superpower.\nFollowing World War II, ideological tensions with the United States eventually led to the Cold War. The American-led Western Bloc coalesced into NATO in 1949, prompting the Soviet Union to form its own military alliance, commonly known as the Warsaw Pact, in 1955. Neither side ever engaged in direct military confrontation, and instead fought on an ideological basis and through proxy wars. In 1953, following Stalin’s death, the Soviet Union undertook a campaign of de-Stalinization under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev, which saw reversals and rejections of Stalinist policies. This campaign caused tensions with Communist China. During the 1950s, the Soviet Union rapidly expanded its efforts in space exploration and took an early lead in the Space Race with the first artificial satellite, the first human spaceflight, the first space station, and the first probe to land on another planet (Venus). The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 was the closest the Cold War came to escalating into full-scale nuclear war.\nThe 1970s saw a brief détente in the Soviet Union’s relationship with the United States, but tensions emerged again following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. From 1985, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to reform the country through his policies of glasnost and perestroika. In 1989, various countries of the Warsaw Pact overthrew their Soviet-backed regimes, and nationalist and separatist movements erupted across the entire Soviet Union. In 1991, amid efforts to reform and preserve the country as a renewed federation, an attempted coup d’état against Gorbachev by hardline communists prompted the three most populous and economically developed republics—Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus—to secede from the Union. On December 26, Gorbachev officially recognized the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin, the leader of the RSFSR, oversaw its reconstitution into the Russian Federation, which became the Soviet Union’s successor state; all other republics emerged as fully independent post-Soviet states.\nDuring its existence, the Soviet Union produced many significant social and technological achievements and innovations. It had the world’s second-largest economy and largest standing military. An NPT-designated state, it wielded the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world. As an Allied nation, it was a founding member of the United Nations as well as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Before its dissolution, the USSR was one of the world’s two superpowers through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, global diplomatic and ideological influence (particularly in the Global South), military and economic strengths, and scientific accomplishments.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Steve-Jobs":{"title":"Steve Jobs","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nSteven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, inventor, and investor best known for co-founding the technology giant Apple Inc.

He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak’s Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.\nIn 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company’s board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he helped develop the visual effects industry by funding the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm that eventually spun off independently as Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and became a leading animation studio, producing over 27 films since.\nIn 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company’s acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the “Think different” advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad.

(Sun for short) was an American technology company that sold computers, computer components, software, and information technology services and created the Java programming language, the Solaris operating system, ZFS, the Network File System (NFS), and SPARC microprocessors. Sun contributed significantly to the evolution of several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing. Notable Sun acquisitions include Cray Business Systems Division, Storagetek, and Innotek GmbH, creators of VirtualBox.  Sun was founded on February 24, 1982. At its height, the Sun headquarters were in Santa Clara, California (part of Silicon Valley), on the former west campus of the Agnews Developmental Center.\nSun products included computer servers and workstations built on its own RISC-based SPARC processor architecture, as well as on x86-based AMD Opteron and Intel Xeon processors. Sun also developed its own storage systems and a suite of software products, including the Solaris operating system, developer tools, Web infrastructure software, and identity management applications. Technologies included the Java platform and NFS.\nIn general, Sun was a proponent of open systems, particularly Unix. It was also a major contributor to open-source software, as evidenced by its $1 billion purchase, in 2008, of MySQL, an open-source relational database management system.\nAt various times, Sun had manufacturing facilities in several locations worldwide, including Newark, California; Hillsboro, Oregon; and Linlithgow, Scotland. However, by the time the company was acquired by Oracle Corporation, it had outsourced most manufacturing responsibilities.\nOn April 20, 2009, it was announced that Oracle would acquire Sun for US$7.4 billion. The deal was completed on January 27, 2010.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/SunOS":{"title":"SunOS","links":["Unix","Unsorted-Items/Sun-Microsystems"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nSunOS is a Unix-branded operating system developed by Sun Microsystems for their workstation and server computer systems.

The text is the first and most systematic attempt by Marx and Engels to codify for wide consumption the historical materialist idea that “the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles”, in which social classes are defined by the relationship of people to the means of production. Published amid the Revolutions of 1848 in Europe, the Manifesto remains one of the world’s most influential political documents.\n\n\nMarx and Engels combine philosophical materialism with the Hegelian dialectical method in order to analyze the development of European society through its modes of production, including primitive communism, antiquity, feudalism, and capitalism, noting the emergence of a new, dominant class at each stage. The text outlines the relationship between the means of production, relations of production, forces of production, and the mode of production, and posits that changes in society’s economic “base” effect changes in its “superstructure”. Marx and Engels assert that capitalism is marked by the exploitation of the proletariat (working class of wage labourers) by the ruling bourgeoisie, which is “constantly revolutionising the instruments [and] relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society”. They argue that capital’s need for a flexible labour force dissolves the old relations, and that its global expansion in search of new markets creates “a world after its own image”.\nThe Manifesto concludes that capitalism does not offer humanity the possibility of self-realization, instead ensuring that humans are perpetually stunted and alienated. It theorizes that capitalism will bring about its own destruction by polarizing and unifying the proletariat, and predicts that a revolution will lead to the emergence of communism, a classless society in which “the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all”. Marx and Engels propose the following transitional policies: the abolition of private property in land and inheritance; introduction of a progressive income tax; confiscation of rebels’ property; nationalisation of credit, communication and transport; expansion and integration of industry and agriculture; enforcement of universal obligation of labour; and provision of universal education and abolition of child labour. The text ends with a decisive and famous call for solidarity, popularized as the slogan “Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains”.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Universal-Serial-Bus":{"title":"Universal Serial Bus","links":["Unsorted-Items/Personal-Computer"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nUniversal Serial Bus (USB) is an industry standard that allows data exchange and delivery of power between many types of electronics. It specifies its architecture, in particular its physical interface, and communication protocols for data transfer and power delivery to and from hosts, such as personal computers, to and from peripheral devices, e.g. displays, keyboards, and mass storage devices, and to and from intermediate hubs, which multiply the number of a host’s ports.\nUSB was originally designed to standardize the connection of peripherals to computers, replacing various interfaces such as serial ports, parallel ports, game ports, and ADB ports. Prior versions of USB became commonplace on a wide range of devices, such as keyboards, mice, cameras, printers, scanners, flash drives, smartphones, game consoles, and power banks. It has evolved into a standard to replace virtually all common ports on computers, mobile devices, peripherals, power supplies, and manifold other small electronics.\nIn the current standard, the USB-C connector replaces the many various connectors for power (up to 240 W), displays (e.g. DisplayPort, HDMI), and many other uses, as well as all previous USB connectors.\nAs of 2024, USB consists of four generations of specifications: USB 1.x, USB 2.0, USB 3.x, and USB4. USB4 enhances the data transfer and power delivery functionality with\na connection-oriented, tunneling architecture designed to combine multiple protocols onto a single physical interface so that the total speed and performance of the USB4 Fabric can be dynamically shared.\nUSB4 particularly supports the tunneling of the Thunderbolt 3 protocols, namely PCI Express (PCIe, load/store interface) and DisplayPort (display interface). USB4 also adds host-to-host interfaces.\nEach specification sub-version supports different signaling rates from 1.5 and 12 Mbit/s total in USB 1.0 to 80 Gbit/s (in each direction) in USB4. USB also provides power to peripheral devices; the latest versions of the standard extend the power delivery limits for battery charging and devices requiring up to 240 watts (USB Power Delivery (USB-PD)). Over the years USB(-PD) has been adopted as the standard power supply and charging format for many mobile devices, such as mobile phones, reducing the need for proprietary chargers.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Unix-like-operating-system":{"title":"Unix-like operating system","links":["Unix"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nA Unix-like (sometimes referred to as UNX or nix) operating system is one that behaves in a manner similar to a Unix system, although not necessarily conforming to or being certified to any version of the Single UNIX Specification. A Unix-like application is one that behaves like the corresponding Unix command or shell. Although there are general philosophies for Unix design, there is no technical standard defining the term, and opinions can differ about the degree to which a particular operating system or application is Unix-like.\nSome well-known examples of Unix-like operating systems include Linux and BSD. These systems are often used on servers as well as on personal computers and other devices. Many popular applications, such as the Apache web server and the Bash shell, are also designed to be used on Unix-like systems.\nOne of the key features of Unix-like systems is their ability to support multiple users and processes simultaneously. This allows users to run multiple programs at the same time and to share resources such as memory and disk space. This is in contrast to many older operating systems, which were designed to only support a single user or process at a time. Another important feature of Unix-like systems is their modularity. This means that the operating system is made up of many small, interchangeable components that can be added or removed as needed. This makes it easy to customize the operating system to suit the needs of different users or environments.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Unsorted-Items":{"title":"Unsorted

Lenin","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nVladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (22 April [O.S. 10 April] 1870 – 21 January 1924), better known as Vladimir Lenin, was a Russian revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He served as the first and founding head of government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1917 until his death in 1924, and of the Soviet Union from 1922 until his death. Under his administration, Russia, and later the Soviet Union, became a one-party socialist state governed by the Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, his developments to the ideology are called Leninism.\nBorn to a schoolteacher’s family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother’s 1887 execution. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Tsarist government, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He relocated to Saint Petersburg in 1893 where he became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye in Siberia for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1903, he took a key role in the RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov’s Mensheviks. Following Russia’s failed Revolution of 1905, he initially campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which, as a Marxist, he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and the rise of socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia and played a leading role in the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new government.\nLenin’s Bolshevik government initially shared power with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, elected soviets, and a multi-party Constituent Assembly, although by 1918 it had centralised power in the new Communist Party. Lenin’s administration redistributed land among the peasantry and nationalised banks and large-scale industry. It withdrew from the First World War by signing a treaty conceding territory to the Central Powers, and promoted world revolution through the Communist International. Opponents were suppressed in the Red Terror, a violent campaign administered by the state security services; tens of thousands were killed or interned in concentration camps. His administration defeated right and left-wing anti-Bolshevik armies in the Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1922 and oversaw the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921. Responding to wartime devastation, famine, and popular uprisings, in 1921 Lenin encouraged economic growth through the New Economic Policy. Several non-Russian nations had secured independence from Russia after 1917, but five were forcibly re-united into the new Soviet Union in 1922, while others repelled Soviet invasions. His health failing, Lenin died in Gorki, with Joseph Stalin succeeding him as the pre-eminent figure in the Soviet government.\nWidely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive personality cult within the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind Marxism–Leninism and a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive historical figure, Lenin is viewed by his supporters as a champion of socialism, communism, anti-imperialism and the working class, while his critics accuse him of establishing a totalitarian dictatorship that oversaw mass killings and political repression of dissidents.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Voice-over-Internet-Protocol":{"title":"Voice over Internet Protocol","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nVoice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), also called IP telephony, is a method and group of technologies for voice calls for the delivery of voice communication sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet.\nThe broader terms Internet telephony, broadband telephony, and broadband phone service specifically refer to the provisioning of voice and other communications services (fax, SMS, voice messaging) over the Internet, rather than via the public switched telephone network (PSTN), also known as plain old telephone service (POTS).\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Warsaw-Pact":{"title":"Warsaw Pact","links":["Unsorted-Items/Soviet-Union","Unsorted-Items/Eastern-Bloc"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\nA collective defense treatey.

Nearly three months after its initial release, it finally made its first retail appearance on October 26, 2012.\nWindows 8 introduced major changes to the operating system’s platform and user interface with the intention to improve its user experience on tablets, where Windows  competed with mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS. In particular, these changes included a touch-optimized Windows shell and start screen based on Microsoft’s Metro design language, integration with online services, the Windows Store, and a new keyboard shortcut for screenshots. Many of these features were adapted from Windows Phone. Windows 8 also added support for USB 3.0, Advanced Format, near-field communication, and cloud computing, as well as a new lock screen with clock and notifications and the previously released “Domino” and “Beauty and a Beat”. Additional security features—including built-in antivirus software, integration with Microsoft SmartScreen phishing filtering, and support for Secure Boot on supported devices—were introduced. It was the first Windows version to support ARM architecture under the Windows RT branding. No CPUs without PAE, SSE2 and NX are supported in this version.\nWindows 8 received a mostly negative reception. Although the reaction to its performance improvements, security enhancements, and improved support for touchscreen devices was positive, the new user interface was widely criticized as confusing and unintuitive, especially when used with a keyboard and mouse rather than a touchscreen. Despite these shortcomings, 60 million licenses were sold through January 2013, including upgrades and sales to OEMs for new PCs.\nMicrosoft released Windows 8.1 in October 2013, which addressed some aspects of Windows 8 that were criticized by reviewers and early adopters and also incorporated various improvements. Windows 8 was ultimately succeeded by Windows 10 in July 2015. Support for RTM editions of Windows 8 ended on January 12, 2016, and with the exception of Windows Embedded 8 Standard users, all users are required to install the Windows 8.1 update.

An updated version of Windows 2000 was also initially planned for the business market. However, in January 2000, both projects were scrapped in favor of a single OS codenamed “Whistler”, which would serve as a single platform for both consumer and business markets. As a result, Windows XP is the first consumer edition of Windows not based on the Windows 95 kernel or MS-DOS. Windows XP removed support for PC-98, i486 and SGI Visual Workstation 320 and 540 and will only run on 32-bit x86 CPUs and devices that use BIOS firmware.\nUpon its release, Windows XP received critical acclaim, noting increased performance and stability (especially compared to Windows Me), a more intuitive user interface, improved hardware support, and expanded multimedia capabilities. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 were succeeded by Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, released in 2007 and 2008, respectively. However, some criticisms of Windows XP were its security issues at launch, and many people believed their anti-piracy schemes had gone too far.\nMainstream support for the main Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009, and extended support ended on April 8, 2014. Windows Embedded POSReady 2009, based on an embedded version of Windows XP Professional, was the last supported version of Windows based on the Windows XP codebase, and received security updates until April 2019.

While most DRAM memory cell designs use a capacitor and transistor, some only use two transistors. In the designs where a capacitor is used, the capacitor can either be charged or discharged; these two states are taken to represent the two values of a bit, conventionally called 0 and 1.  The electric charge on the capacitors gradually leaks away; without intervention the data on the capacitor would soon be lost.  To prevent this, DRAM requires an external memory refresh circuit which periodically rewrites the data in the capacitors, restoring them to their original charge. This refresh process is the defining characteristic of dynamic random-access memory, in contrast to static random-access memory (SRAM) which does not require data to be refreshed. Unlike flash memory, DRAM is volatile memory (vs. non-volatile memory), since it loses its data quickly when power is removed. However, DRAM does exhibit limited data remanence.\nDRAM typically takes the form of an integrated circuit chip, which can consist of dozens to billions of DRAM memory cells. DRAM chips are widely used in digital electronics where low-cost and high-capacity computer memory is required. One of the largest applications for DRAM is the main memory (colloquially called the “RAM”) in modern computers and graphics cards (where the “main memory” is called the graphics memory).  It is also used in many portable devices and video game consoles.  In contrast, SRAM, which is faster and more expensive than DRAM, is typically used where speed is of greater concern than cost and size, such as the cache memories in processors.\nThe need to refresh DRAM demands more complicated circuitry and timing than SRAM. This is offset by the structural simplicity of DRAM memory cells: only one transistor and a capacitor are required per bit, compared to four or six transistors in SRAM. This allows DRAM to reach very high densities with a simultaneous reduction in cost per bit. Refreshing the data consumes power and a variety of techniques are used to manage the overall power consumption.\nDRAM had a 47% increase in the price-per-bit in 2017, the largest jump in 30 years since the 45% jump in 1988, while in recent years the price has been going down. In 2018, a “key characteristic of the DRAM market is that there are currently only three major suppliers — Micron Technology, SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics” that are “keeping a pretty tight rein on their capacity”. There is also Kioxia (previously Toshiba Memory Corporation after 2017 spin-off). Other manufacturers make and sell DIMMs (but not the DRAM chips in them), such as Kingston Technology, and some manufacturers that sell stacked DRAM (used e.g. in the fastest supercomputers on the exascale), separately such as Viking Technology. Others sell such integrated into other products, such as Fujitsu into its CPUs, AMD in GPUs, and Nvidia, with HBM2 in some of their GPU chips.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/iOS":{"title":"iOS","links":["Unsorted-Items/iPadOS","Unsorted-Items/tvOS"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\niOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its smartphones.

These mobile apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times.\niOS is based on macOS.  Like macOS, it includes components of the Mach microkernel and FreeBSD. It is a Unix-like operating system.  Although some parts of iOS are open source under the Apple Public Source License and other licenses, iOS is proprietary software.\nMajor versions of iOS are released annually. The current stable version, iOS 17, was released to the public on September 18, 2023.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/iPadOS":{"title":"iPadOS","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\niPadOS is a mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc. for its iPad line of tablet computers.

The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer’s central processing unit (CPU). The IC is capable of interpreting and executing program instructions and performing arithmetic operations. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock-driven, register-based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results (also in binary form) as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic, and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system.\nThe integration of a whole CPU onto a single or a few integrated circuits using Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) greatly reduced the cost of processing power. Integrated circuit processors are produced in large numbers by highly automated metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) fabrication processes, resulting in a relatively low unit price. Single-chip processors increase reliability because there are fewer electrical connections that can fail. As microprocessor designs improve, the cost of manufacturing a chip (with smaller components built on a semiconductor chip the same size) generally stays the same according to Rock’s law.\nBefore microprocessors, small computers had been built using racks of circuit boards with many medium- and small-scale integrated circuits, typically of TTL type. Microprocessors combined this into one or a few large-scale ICs. While there is disagreement over who deserves credit for the invention of the microprocessor, the first commercially available microprocessor was the Intel 4004, designed by Federico Faggin and introduced in 1971.\nContinued increases in microprocessor capacity have since rendered other forms of computers almost completely obsolete (see history of computing hardware), with one or more microprocessors used in everything from the smallest embedded systems and handheld devices to the largest mainframes and supercomputers.\nA microprocessor is distinct from a microcontroller including a system on a chip. A microprocessor is related but distinct from a digital signal processor.\nWikipedia\n\nExam Alerts\nsaa_exam_alerts\nKey words"},"Unsorted-Items/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-approaches-to-input-output":{"title":"synchronous vs asynchronous approaches to input-output","links":["tags/saa_exam_alerts"],"tags":["saa_exam_alerts"],"content":"Overview\nExam Alerts\nsaa_exam_alerts\nKey words"},"Unsorted-Items/tvOS":{"title":"tvOS","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\ntvOS (formerly Apple TV Software) is an operating system developed by Apple Inc. for the Apple TV, a digital media player.

Apple also changed the name of the Apple TV operating system to tvOS, adopting the camel case nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems, iOS and watchOS.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/x86":{"title":"x86","links":["Unsorted-Items/Complex-instruction-set-computer"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nx86 (also known as 80x86 or the 8086 family) is a family of complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architectures initially developed by Intel based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor and its 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel’s 8-bit 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term “x86” came into being because the names of several successors to Intel’s 8086 processor end in “86”, including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. Colloquially, their names were “186”, “286”, “386” and “486”.\nThe term is not synonymous with IBM PC compatibility, as this implies a multitude of other computer hardware. Embedded systems and general-purpose computers used x86 chips before the PC-compatible market started, some of them before the IBM PC (1981) debut.\nAs of June 2022, most desktop and laptop computers sold are based on the x86 architecture family, while mobile categories such as smartphones or tablets are dominated by ARM. At the high end, x86 continues to dominate computation-intensive workstation and cloud computing segments. The fastest supercomputer in the TOP500 list for June 2022 was the first exascale system, Frontier, built using AMD Epyc CPUs based on the x86 ISA; it broke the 1 exaFLOPS barrier in May 2022.\nWikipedia\n"},"vault_resources/templates/folder_note_template":{"title":"folder_note_template","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"%% Overview %&lt;% tp.file.cursor(1) %&gt;%"},"vault_resources/templates/note_template":{"title":"note_template","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\nKey words"}}
